    <p>
      Among all deities, overdeities are the most ancient. These primordial gods
      have existed as long as the multiverse itself, and wield tremendeous
      power, even by the standards of godly beings.

    <h6>The Small Council</h6>
    <p>
      Among the overdeities, there is a group known as the Small Council. Few
      know of its existence, and no one knows its purpose. The Small Council
      consists of Amaunator, Ao, Chroneria, Dendar, Mystryl, Pandorym,
      Praeteria, Primus, and Quilrith.
    </p>

    <h5>The Writer</h5>
    <p>
      <p>
        The mysterious being known as the Writer is an overdeity that very few can
        even contact, let alone wield the power of. The Writer is thought to be so
        powerful as to dwarf the power of all other overdeities combined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some believe the Writer to be merely a prophetic being, the writings of whom seem to mysteriously align with the events that transpire.  These scholars hypothesize that the Writer lacks any power of their own.  As no one has contacted the Writer thoroughly, it is impossible to determine the truth of these ideas.
      </p>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h5>Amaunator</h5>
    <p>
      Amaunator, known as Lathander in some spheres, is the primordial god of
      light and birth. He commonly appears as a paladin in shining armor and
      wielding a heavy mace, and he is the most likely to interact with mortals.
    </p>
    <h5>Ao</h5>
    <p>
      Ao is thought to be the first of the overdeities, second only to The
      Writer. He often appears as an old man in deep blue robes, carrying a pair
      of stone tablets. Ao policies the actions of the other overdeities,
      preventing them from interacting with mortals too often.
    </p>
    <h5>Chroneria</h5>
    <p>
      Chroneria was once the overdeity of time, a beautiful woman with sky blue
      hair. Not long ago, she attempted to wield the Aethergem to take control
      of the entire multiverse, but she was stopped by Quilrith and the
      adventurers who she tried to get to do her bidding.
    </p>
    <h5>Dendar</h5>
    <p>
      Dendar is the primordial goddess of night. Always in the form of an
      enormous black cobra, she was imprisoned long ago in a strange plane known
      as Jazirah. Dendar constantly plots her escape, and almost succeeded not
      long ago.
    </p>
    <h5>Lady of Pain</h5>
    <p>
      The enigmatic being known as the Lady of Pain is a deity of neutrality,
      one with the power to rewrite the multiverse, though few know of her true
      godly nature. The Lady rules Sigil, the city of doors, and violently
      eschews all worship. She is rarely seen and only ever acts in times of
      extreme emergency. At all other times, she simply keeps watch over her
      city and holds the multiverse in check.
    </p>
    <h5>Mystryl</h5>
    <p>
      Mystryl, the ancient goddess of magic, was the very architect of the
      Spellweave that all other magic in the multiverse calls upon. In some
      ways, Mystryl is the Spellweave herself. The wife of Primus, she long ago
      entered Limbo to investigate a strange anomaly, and never returned.
    </p>
    <h5>[null]</h5>
    <p>
      Little is known about the god of chaos [null]. It is known that this god
      is the counterpart to Primus' law, but the god itself has not been seen
      nor heard of as far as anyone can remember. It is thought that [null] is
      in some way connected to Limbo, plane of chaos, but investigations have
      all turned up dry.
    </p>
    <h5>Pandorym</h5>
    <p>
      Pandorym was once an unstoppable force of the Astral Void, a sort of
      living, evil sphere of annihilation the size of a small moon. The only way
      it could be mitigated was to separate its essence from its body, trapping
      the essence within a crystal sphere. Which crystal sphere and where within
      it is lost to history.
    </p>
    <h5>Praeteria</h5>
    <p>
      Praeteria was the creator of any and all of the humanoid races. Few of her
      original creations remain, but her legacy can be seen in all life. She
      rarely appears, usually prefering to exist as a sort of live-giving mana
      that permeates the multiverse, but when she does appear it is as a dryad.
    </p>
    <h5>Primus</h5>
    <p>
      Primus is the god of order and law, and the creator of the modron race. In
      his Hall of Concordance on the plane of Mechanus, he serves to keep the
      multiverse stable. The modron race is effectively an extension of himself,
      and it is countless in number.
    </p>
    <h5>Quilrith</h5>
    <p>
      Quilrith is usually regarded as the leader of the Small Council by those
      who know his true nature. He normally takes the form of a dragonborn
      wizard and travels the multiverse. However, if any threats to the
      multiverse present themselves, he takes upon the form of a great beast to
      restore balance.
