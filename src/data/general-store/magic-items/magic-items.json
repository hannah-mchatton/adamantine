Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 11 (2d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns; a creature can end this damage by using its action to wash off the acid with a pint or more of water. <h4>Fire Jet</h4> The cannon discharges fire in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn't reduced.

    "description": "Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.<br><br>Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With them, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.<br><br>Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.<br><br>Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it. <h4>Magic Weapon</h4> The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. <h4>Random Properties</h4> The axe has the following randomly determined properties:<ul><li>2 minor beneficial properties</li><li>1 major beneficial property</li><li>2 minor detrimental properties</li></ul> <h4>Dwarvenkind</h4> While you are attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits: <ul><li>Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.</li><li>You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with dwarves.</li></ul>In addition, while attuned to the axe, you have a 50 percent chance each day at dawn of growing a full beard if you're capable of growing one, or a visibly thicker beard if you already have one.If you aren't a dwarf, you gain the following additional benefits while attuned to the axe:<ul><li>You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.</li><li>You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</li><li>You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish.</li></ul><h4>Throwing</h4> The axe has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8 damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.<h4>Blessings of Moradin</h4> If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:<ul><li>You have immunity to poison damage.</li><li>The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.</li><li>You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.</li></ul> <h4>Conjure Earth Elemental</h4> If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=144\" class=\"spell-link\">Conjure Elemental</a> spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can't use this property again until the next dawn. <h4>Travel the Depths</h4> You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=758\" class=\"spell-link\">Teleport</a> spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed. <h4>Curse</h4> The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell. <h4>Destroying the Axe</h4> The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.",

Its current wielder is a former member of Force Grey named Meloon Wardragon, but the weapon is searching for a new owner.<br><br>Azuredge has a solid steel handle etched with tiny runes, wrapped in blue dragon hide with a star sapphire set into the pommel. The axe head is forged from silver, electrum, and steel alloys whose edges constantly shimmer with a deep blue luminescence.<br><br>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The Shield spell provides no defense against the axe, which passes through that spell's barrier of magical force.<br><br>When you hit a fiend or an undead with the axe, cold blue flames erupt from its blade and deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target. <h4>Hurling</h4> The battleaxe has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the axe, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. Whether it hits or misses, the axe flies back to you at the end of the current turn, landing in your open hand or at your feet in your space (as you choose). The axe regains all expended charges daily at dawn. <h4>Illumination</h4> While holding the axe, you can use an action to cause the axe to glow blue or to quench the glow. This glow sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. <h4>Sentience</h4> Azuredge is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.<br><br>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. It has a calm, delicate voice. The weapon can sense the presence of non-lawful creatures within 120 feet of it. <h5>Personality</h5> Azuredge is sworn to protect Waterdeep, and it desires to be wielded by a law-abiding person willing to dedicate everything to the city's defense. The weapon is patient and takes its time finding its ideal wielder.<br><br>If someone tries to use Azuredge against its will, the axe can become ten times heavier than normal, and can magically adhere to any Medium or larger object or surface it comes into contact with. Once it does so, the axe can't be wielded. Nothing short of a Wish spell can separate the axe from the item or surface to which it is adhered without destroying one or the other, though the axe can choose to end the effect at any time.",

    "type": "wondrous item",

    "attunementDesc": "",
    "description": "The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn. <h4>Random Properties</h4> This artifact has the following random properties:<ul><li>2 minor beneficial properties</li><li>1 major beneficial property</li><li>1 minor detrimental property</li></ul> <h4>Properties of the Mortar</h4> The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding-if there's enough space-up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature. <h4>Properties of the Pestle</h4> The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.<br><br>The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn. <h4>Perfect Tools</h4> While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.<br><br>You can also use the artifact as alchemist's supplies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner's kit. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools. <h4>Primal Parts</h4> As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles. <h4>Traverse the Night</h4> If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature.<br><br>You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination - not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later. <h5>Bones Know Their Home</h5> When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute. <h4>Destroying the Mortar and Pestle</h4> The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga or by Baba Yaga herself.",

    "description": "The Blackstaff is a sentient, rune-carved staff set with thin silver veins. It is the symbol of office for the Blackstaff, the highest-ranking wizard in Waterdeep. As the rightful owner of the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr is the only one who can become attuned to it. The staff can, however, choose a new owner. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.<br><br>The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regain 1d8 + 2 charges. <h4>Power Strike</h4> When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target. <h4>Spells</h4> While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=138\" class=\"spell-link\">Cone of Cold</a> (5 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=291\" class=\"spell-link\">Fireball</a> (5th-level version, 5 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=341\" class=\"spell-link\">Globe of Invulnerability</a> (6 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=399\" class=\"spell-link\">Hold Monster</a> (5 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=461\" class=\"spell-link\">Levitate</a> (2 charges). <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=466\" class=\"spell-link\">Lightning Bolt</a> (5th-level version, 5 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=484\" class=\"spell-link\">Magic Missile</a> (1 charge), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=619\" class=\"spell-link\">Ray of Enfeeblement</a> (1 charge), or <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=821\" class=\"spell-link\">Wall of Force</a> (5 charges). <h4>Retributive Strike</h4> You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.<br><br>You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 ? the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.<br><br><table><tr><th>Distance from Origin</th><th>Effect</th></tr><tr><td>10 ft. away or closer</td><td>8 ? the number of charges in the staff</td></tr><tr><td>11 to 20 ft. away</td><td>6 ? the number of charges in the staff</td></tr><tr><td>21 to 30 ft. away</td><td>4 ? the number of charges in the staff</td></tr></table><h4>Animate Walking Statues</h4> You can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the walking statues of Waterdeep. You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun's spirit, which is trapped inside the staff. A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken. Dispel Magic. You can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast dispel magic on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before you can expend the charge to cast the spell. <h4>Drain Magic</h4> This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal. <h4>Master of Enchantment</h4> When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot. <h4>Sentience</h4> The Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it. <h5>Personality</h5> The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.<br><br>In the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor-someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach. <h4>Spirit Trap</h4> When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.) Destroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again.",

    "description": "The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the fabled Book of Exalted Deeds figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various authors filled the pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.<br><br>The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.<br><br>A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.<br><br>Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. <h4>Random Properties</h4> The Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties:<ul><li>2 minor beneficial properties</li><li>2 major beneficial properties</li></ul> <h4>Increased Wisdom</h4> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can't gain this benefit from the book more than once. <h4>Enlightened Magic</h4> Once you've read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a Divine spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher. <h4>Halo</h4> Once you've read and studied the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo's bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage. <h4>Destroying the Book</h4> It is rumored that the Book of Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years.",

    "attunementDesc": "",
    "description": "The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness.<br><br>Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.<br><br>Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can't be divined.<br><br>Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.<br><br>A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.<br><br>Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to neutral evil.<br><br>The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned. <h4>Random Properties</h4> The Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties:<ul><li>3 minor beneficial properties</li><li>1 major beneficial property</li><li>3 minor detrimental properties</li><li>2 major detrimental properties</li></ul> <h4>Adjusted Ability Scores</h4> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again. <h4>Mark of Darkness</h4> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures. <h4>Command Evil</h4> While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=224\" class=\"spell-link\">Dominate Monster</a> spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can't use this property again until the next dawn. <h4>Dark Lore</h4> You can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check. <h4>Dark Speech</h4> While you carry the Book of Vile Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite word from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage. <h4>Destroying the Book</h4> The Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.<br><br>If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.<br><br>A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 ? 100 years later.<br><br>If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.",

    "attunementDesc": "",
    "description": "Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao - potentially for the final time. <h4>Random Properties</h4> The artifact has the following random properties:<ul><li>2 minor beneficial properties</li><li>1 major beneficial property</li><li>1 minor detrimental property</li></ul> <h4>Spells</h4> The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=53\" class=\"spell-link\">Aura of Life</a> (2 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=54\" class=\"spell-link\">Aura of Purity</a> (2 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=61\" class=\"spell-link\">Banishment</a> (1 charge), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=66\" class=\"spell-link\">Beacon of Hope</a> (1 charge), or <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=498\" class=\"spell-link\">Mass Cure Wounds</a> (3 charges). The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. <h4>Absolute Banishment</h4> While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can't return to the plane the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years. <h4>Failing Matrix</h4> Whenever the Crook of Rao's Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control. <table><thead><tr><th>d100</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-25</td><td>A portal to a random plane opens. The portal closes after 5 minutes.</td></tr><tr><td>26-45</td><td>2d4 imps and 2d4 quasits appear.</td></tr><tr><td>46-60</td><td>1d8 succubi/incubi appear.</td></tr><tr><td>61-70</td><td>1d10 barbed devils and 1d10 vrocks appear.</td></tr><tr><td>71-80</td><td>1 arcanaloth, 1 night hag, and 1 rakshasa appear.</td></tr><tr><td>81-85</td><td>1 ice devil and 1 marilith appear.</td></tr><tr><td>86-90</td><td>1 balor and 1 pit fiend appear. At the DM's discretion, a portal opens into the presence of an archdevil or demon lord instead, then closes after 5 minutes.</td></tr><tr><td>91-00</td><td>Iggwilv's Curse</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Iggwilv's Curse</h4> When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=328\" class=\"spell-link\">Gate</a> spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.<h4>Destroying or Repairing the Crook</h4> The Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.",

Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. <h4>A Question of Enmity</h4> Two of the cards in a deck of many things can earn a character the enmity of another being. With the Flames card, the enmity is overt. The character should experience the devil's malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking out the fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash with the devil's allies and followers a few times before being able to confront the devil itself.<br><br>In the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.<h5>Vizier</h5> At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it. <h5>Sun</h5> You level up, and a wondrous item (which the DM determines) appears in your hands. <h5>Moon</h5> You are granted the ability to cast the <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=845\" class=\"spell-link\">Wish</a> spell 1d3 times. <h5>Star</h5> Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24. <h5>Comet</h5> If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect. <h5>The Fates</h5> Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die. <h5>Throne</h5> You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours. <h5>Key</h5> A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon. <h5>Knight</h5> You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character. <h5>Gem</h5> Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1000 gp each appear at your feet. <h5>Talons</h5> Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish. <h5>The Void</h5> This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards. <h5>Flames</h5> A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies. <h5>Skull</h5> You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life. <h5>Idiot</h5> Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws. <h5>Donjon</h5> You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a Wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards. <h5>Ruin</h5> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears. <h5>Euryale</h5> The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse. <h5>Rogue</h5> A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you. <h5>Balance</h5> Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you. <h5>Fool</h5> You must draw from the deck again, which does not count towards your number of declared draws. <h5>Jester</h5> You level up, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.",

    "attunementDesc": "",
    "description": "An expansive treatise documenting the Abyss's infinite layers and inhabitants, the Demonomicon of Iggwilv is the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book's spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material. <h4>Random Properties</h4> The artifact has the follow random properties:<ul><li>2 minor beneficial properties</li><li>1 minor detrimental property</li><li>1 major detrimental property</li></ul> <h4>Spells</h4> The book has 8 charges. It regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to cast <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=753\" class=\"spell-link\">Tasha's Hideous Laughter</a> from it or to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20) from it: <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=482\" class=\"spell-link\">Magic Circle</a> (1 charge), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=483\" class=\"spell-link\">Magic Jar</a> (3 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=567\" class=\"spell-link\">Planar Ally</a> (3 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=586\" class=\"spell-link\">Planar Binding</a> (2 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=569\" class=\"spell-link\">Plane Shift</a> (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=737\" class=\"spell-link\">Summon Fiend</a> (3 charges). <h4>Abyssal Reference</h4> You can reference the Demonomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check. <h4>Fiendish Scourging</h4> Your magic causes pain to fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling. <h4>Ensnarement</h4> While carrying the book, whenever you cast the Magic Circle spell naming only fiends, or the Planar Binding spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell. <h4>Containment</h4> The first 10 pages of the Demonomicon are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is trapped within a magic circle. The fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the Demonomicon's empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can't be used again until the next dawn.<br><br>When you finish a long rest, if you and the Demonomicon are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can't try to possess you again for 7 days.<br><br>When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons. <h4>Destroying the Demonomicon</h4> To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book's remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, Fraz-Urb'luu's Staff. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx, the work that served as the foundation for the Demonomicon. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu instantly knows.",

    "attunementDesc": "",
    "description": "Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.<br><br>Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.<br><br>Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world.<br><br>The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.<br><br>To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.<br><br>To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die. <h4>Random Properties</h4> The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties:<ul><li>1 minor beneficial property</li><li>1 major beneficial property</li><li>1 minor detrimental property</li></ul> <h4>Properties of the Eye</h4> Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:<ul><li>You have truesight out to 120 feet.</li><li>You can use an action see into and through solid matter for 1 minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead. You can end this effect as a bonus action. Whenever you use this property of the eye again before taking a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.</li><li>The eye has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=122\" class=\"spell-link\">Clairvoyance</a> (2 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=178\" class=\"spell-link\">Crown of Madness</a> (1 charge), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=211\" class=\"spell-link\">Disintegrate</a> (4 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=224\" class=\"spell-link\">Dominate Monster</a> (5 charges), or <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=271\" class=\"spell-link\">Eyebite</a> (4 charges). The eye regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM's control.</li></ul> <h4>Properties of the Hand</h4> Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:<ul><li>Your Strength score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher.</li><li>Any melee spell attack you make with the hand, and any melee weapon attack made with a weapon held by it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit.</li><li>The hand has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=287\" class=\"spell-link\">Finger of Death</a> (5 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=688\" class=\"spell-link\">Sleep</a> (1 charge), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=690\" class=\"spell-link\">Slow</a> (2 charges), or <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=758\" class=\"spell-link\">Teleport</a> (3 charges). The hand regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the hand, it casts the <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=729\" class=\"spell-link\">Suggestion</a> spell on you (save DC 18), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.</li></ul> <h4>Properties of the Eye and Hand</h4> If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:<ul><li>You are immune to disease and poison.</li><li>Using the eye's x-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.</li><li>You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised.</li><li>If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points.</li><li>If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice of your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.</li><li>You can use an action to cast the <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=845\" class=\"spell-link\">Wish</a> spell. This property can't be used again until 30 days have passed.</li></ul> <h4>Destroying the Eye and Hand</h4> If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.",

Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours.

The point where you trace it becomes the center of a spherical area of magic that has a 30-foot radius and that is fixed to the place. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the gavel to be within 5 feet of you.

    "description": "Iggwilv crafted this wondrous cauldron with the help of her adoptive mother, the archfey Baba Yaga. The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes-eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid. <h4>Attunement</h4> Any Humanoid creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be aged to the point of decrepitude. In this state, the creature's speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to 30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach the end of its natural life span in 3d8 days. Only a Wish spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature.<br><br>Three hags can attune to the cauldron simultaneously, provided they have formed a coven. If the coven disbands, the attunement ends for all three hags. <h4>Random Properties</h4> Regardless of the form it takes, the cauldron has the following random properties:<ul><li>1 minor beneficial property</li><li>1 minor detrimental property</li></ul> <h4>Gold Cauldron</h4> The gold cauldron has the following properties:<ul><li>If water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew that provides one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon of water used. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew.</li><li>If wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir that fortifies up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that imbibes the elixir gains 10 temporary hit points. Any of the elixir that isn't consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.</li><li>When the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for a <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=651\" class=\"spell-link\">Scrying</a> spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell fails its saving throw automatically, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on different planes of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes.</li><li>Dipping the bristles of an ordinary broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a Broom of Flying for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.</li></ul> <h4>Iron Cauldron.</h4> The iron cauldron has the following properties:<ul><li>You can use an action to scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a swarm of bats that flies out of the cauldron and acts immediately after you in the initiative order. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute if it hasn't been destroyed by then. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.</li><li>If at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall unconscious for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being charmed. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An unconscious creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.</li><li>Tying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a Wand of Polymorph with 3 charges. This wand can't recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again for 8 days.</li><li>If you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a unicorn's horn while reciting the poem called <em>The Witch Queen's Cauldron</em>, all creatures within 1000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, doesn't age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can't be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to another plane of existence, or touching it with a unicorn's horn for 1 minute while reciting <em>The Witch Queen's Cauldron</em> ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or is touched by a unicorn's horn.</li></ul> <h4>Destroying the Cauldron</h4> The cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a flame tongue or frost brand weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.<br><br>The destruction of Iggwilv's Cauldron causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven. <h5>Reconstructing the Cauldron</h5> If all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a wish spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties. The cauldron's reconstruction also restores the Shared Spellcasting trait of hag covens throughout the multiverse.<h4>The Witch Queen's Cauldron</h4> As explained in the descriptionription of Iggwilv's Cauldron, the poem titled <em>The Witch Queen's Cauldron</em> is an incantation that hints at the time-freezing property of the artifact: <br><em>Eight cats perch atop eight dead attending<br>Eight lizards flee from eight cats scavenging<br>Eight toads climbing meet eight dead and falling<br>Eight snakes sneak under eight bats screaming<br>Eight eyes open, always dreaming<br>All on the cauldron that is ever seeming</em>",

At the end, the ingot is destroyed, and the rune appears in silver on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form: <h5>Shield</h5> The shield is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. Its magic gives you a +1 bonus to AC, and the first time after each of your long rests that damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point. You must be wielding the shield to gain these benefits. <h5>Weapon</h5> The weapon is now an uncommon magic weapon. It grants you a +1 bonus to AC while you're holding it.",

    "type": "wondrous item",
    "attunement": true,
    "attunementDesc": "",
    "description": "Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the Mighty Servant of Leuk-o is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often descriptionribed as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.<br><br>Tales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the Machine of Lum the Mad. The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the Mind of Metal, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o. <h4>Dangerous Attunement</h4> Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.<br><br>The servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.<br><br>Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact. <h4>Controlling the Servant</h4> While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A Knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster's next turn.<br><br>A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.<br><br>While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:<ul><li>Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)</li><li>Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)</li><li>As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.</li><li>When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.</li></ul>While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object. <h4>Ghost in the Machine</h4> Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.<br><br>If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible. <h4>Self-Destruct</h4> By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.<br><br>If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.<br><br>This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts-left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso-drop from the sky in random places within 1000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant. <h4>Destroying the Servant</h4> The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant's self-destruct property.<table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"6\">Mighty Servant of Leuk-o</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Huge Construct</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Armor Class</strong> 22 (natural armor)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Hit Points</strong> 310 (27d12 + 135)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Speed</strong> 60 ft.</td></tr><tr><th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th></tr><tr><td>30 (+10)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>20 (+5)</td><td>1 (-5)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>10 (+0)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wis +9, Cha +7</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Skills:</strong> Perception +9</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Damage Resistances:</strong> piercing, slashing</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Condition Immunities:</strong> all conditions but invisible and prone</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Senses:</strong> blindsight 120 ft., passive Perception 19</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Languages:</strong> understands the languages of creatures attuned to it but can't speak</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Challenge:</strong> '</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Proficiency Bonus:</strong> +7</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong><em>Immutable Existence.</em></strong> The servant is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form or send it to another plane of existence.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong><em>Magic Resistant Construction.</em></strong> The servant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks made against it have disadvantage.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> The servant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.

The orb has an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 16, as well as hearing and darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. The orb can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature touching it.

This isn't a power of the orb that you control. <h4>Curse</h4> Any Humanoid you touch while holding the orb must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. Each creature cursed by the orb bears an echo of Murgaxor's hateful thoughts, and that creature suffers from headaches that are persistent but not debilitating until the curse ends. On your turn, the orb can use an action to produce one of the following effects, targeting one or more creatures it has cursed.<br><br>After either of these effects ends, the affected creature is no longer cursed. The curse can also be removed from a creature with a remove curse spell or similar magic. All cases of the curse end if Murgaxor's orb is destroyed. <h5>Unconsciousness</h5> The cursed creature falls unconscious for 1 hour. The creature is roused if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. <h5>Visions of Terror</h5> The cursed creature sees terrifying visions, causing it to view all creatures that aren't also cursed as dangerous monsters for 10 minutes. The cursed creature must use its action each round to make one attack against the nearest non-cursed creature. If the cursed creature has multiple possible targets, it attacks one at random. This effect ends if the cursed creature is incapacitated. <h4>Destroying the Orb</h4> Murgaxor's orb has AC 18; 20 hit points; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage; and resistance to all other types of damage.

    "description": "Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.<br><br>As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.<br><br>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.<br><br>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.<br><br>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.<br><br>While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=729\" class=\"spell-link\">Suggestion</a> on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides. <h4>Random Properties</h4> An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:<ul><li>2 minor beneficial properties</li><li>1 minor detrimental property</li><li>1 major detrimental property</li></ul> <h4>Spells</h4> The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=181\" class=\"spell-link\">Cure Wounds</a> (5th-level version, 3 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=191\" class=\"spell-link\">Daylight</a> (1 charge), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=193\" class=\"spell-link\">Death Ward</a> (2 charges), or <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=651\" class=\"spell-link\">Scrying</a> (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges. <h4>Call Dragons</h4> While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour. <h4>Destroying an Orb</h4> An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A Disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.",

It knows little more than the desire to face orcs in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, deception, or disloyalty. The weapon's purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarves - giants, goblins, and, most of all, orcs - and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle.",

    "description": "This delicate and exquisitely crafted clockwork orrery features multiple geared components whose sweeping hands and dials represent the complex interplay of planar and magical realms. Standing two feet high, the orrery housing is a wondrous device imbued with magic of its own, but the power of its six clockwork components makes the artifact even more potent.<br><br>The Orrery of the Wanderer was created by a renowned clockwork mage known only as Lottie. She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.<br><br>To prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world. But the Orrery's instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again-and moving closer to each other all the time.<h4>Random Properties</h4> The orrery has the following randomly determined properties:<ul><li>2 minor beneficial properties</li><li>1 major beneficial property</li><li>1 major detrimental properties</li></ul> The random properties of the orrery might function only when all its components are installed, or might function sporadically if any components are missing. <h4>The Sum of Its Parts</h4> Each of the six components that powers the Orrery of the Wanderer is a powerful magic relic in its own right: The Chronolometer, Dimensional Loop, Far Gear, Rotor of Return, Timepiece of Travel, and Wheel of Stars. Creatures can attune to the orrery's components individually. If attuned to an individual component, a creature must hold the component to make use of its features. A creature can also attune to the orrery and all the components installed in it. Attuning to an installed component doesn't count against the number of magic items you can normally attune to.<br><br>While a component is not installed in the orrery, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM. <h4>Future Echoes</h4> With or without its components, the orrery lets you catch momentary glimpses of the future that warn you of danger. As long as the orrery is within 30 feet of you, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. <h4>Into the Void</h4> With or without its components, the attuned orrery infuses your spirit with the tumultuous energy of the planes. Over time, your alignment changes to chaotic neutral, and you are compelled to engage with and explore the most dangerous planar realms. <h4>Master of Travel</h4> While all six components of the Orrery of the Wanderer are installed, the artifact has 7 charges. While touching the orrery, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=153\" class=\"spell-link\">Contact Other Plane</a> (3 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=197\" class=\"spell-link\">Demiplane</a> (6 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=328\" class=\"spell-link\">Gate</a> (7 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=569\" class=\"spell-link\">Plane Shift</a> (5 charges), or <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=759\" class=\"spell-link\">Teleportation Circle</a> (3 charges).

If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.<br><br>Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.<br><br>",

The armor has been worked to create the appearance of a heavily muscled warrior, and its great helm is unusual in that it has no openings-only a broad glass plate in the front with a second piece of glass above it. Strange plates, tubing, and large metal bosses adorn the armor in seemingly random fashion.

You can use a bonus action to draw power from an energy cell or sacrifice hit points to gain one of the following benefits:Emit a force field to gain 2d6 + 5 temporary hit points (1 charge or 5 hit points).Activate boosters to gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1 minute (1 charge or 5 hit points).Fire arm-mounted laser: Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 120 feet, one target. Hit: 2d6 radiant damage (1 charge or 5 hit points).Translate any writing you can see in any nonmagical language, to a total of one thousand words over 1 minute (1 charge or 5 hit points).Fill the armor with air, allowing you to breathe normally in any environment for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points).Gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points).The armor can accept only one energy cell at a time. It is found with one energy cell attached, containing 2d10 charges.<br><br>Powered Armor Options[-]Depending on where and how it appears in the adventure, you might wish to modify the features of Kwalish's legendary powered armor. Automatic Defenses. Unless Kwalish deactivates the suit's automatic defenses, no one can approach the armor without setting those defenses off. Treat the armor as a shield guardian that has stored a magic missile spell cast using a 4th-level spell slot. When the armor is reduced to 0 hit points, its defenses are rendered inert and it can be safely approached. Battle of Wills. When donned by a new user, the armor deems itself superior and attempts to take possession of that user. The user must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the armor. While possessed, the user is incapacitated and loses control of its body but retains its awareness. The armor uses the possessed user's statistics (as adjusted by the armor), but doesn't gain access to the user's knowledge, features, or proficiencies.<br><br>Freeing a creature trapped inside the armor first requires defeating the armor's automatic defenses (as above). The trapped creature can also attempt a DC 20 Charisma saving throw each day at dawn. On a successful save, the armor no longer controls the creature and can be safely donned by that creature at any time. Stasis. Whenever a creature wearing the armor drops to 0 hit points, the armor places that creature into a state of stasis. While in this state, the creature is stable and does not make death saving throws, but the armor takes control of the creature (as above). Additionally, the armor attempts to assume the identity of the user, assuring their allies that nothing is amiss. Freeing the user first requires defeating the armor's automatic defenses (as above). A creature in stasis does not make Charisma saving throws to break the armor's control. Alternative Power. Powered armor originally required energy cells to fuel it, but was adapted by Kwalish to be fueled by the life energy of the creature wearing it. You might decide that the armor can also draw power from additional sources, or that energy cells can be recharged with the aid of a tinker, inventor, or artificer. It might also be possible for allies to connect to the armor through the use of magic that generates a conduit something like an astral silver cord. While so connected, a willing ally can give up hit points as a reaction to fuel the armor's abilities.",

The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to this ring.<br><br>The Ring of Winter is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it. If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring the wearer's doom. <h4>Sentience</h4> The Ring of Winter is a sentient chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others. <h4>Nondetection</h4> The Ring of Winter defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors. <h4>Frozen Time</h4> As long as you wear the ring, you don't age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesn't catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesn't protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a ghost. <h4>Cold Immunity</h4> While attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and don't suffer any ill effects from extreme cold. <h4>Cold Mastery</h4> The Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:<ul><li>You can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of -30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.</li><li>You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=76\" class=\"spell-link\">Bigby's Hand</a> (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=138\" class=\"spell-link\">Cone of Cold</a> (2 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=300\" class=\"spell-link\">Flesh To Stone</a> (3 charges; the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=414\" class=\"spell-link\">Ice Storm</a> (2 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=554\" class=\"spell-link\">Otiluke's Freezing Sphere</a> (3 charges), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=689\" class=\"spell-link\">Sleet Storm</a> (1 charge), <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=709\" class=\"spell-link\">Spike Growth</a> (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=822\" class=\"spell-link\">Wall of Ice</a> (2 charges).</li><li>You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts.</li></ul> <h4>Other Properties</h4> The Ring of Winter is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can't break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a djinni in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as the mighty ice primordial named Cryonax. <h4>Destroying the Ring</h4> The ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful archfey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever.",

Once the shield uses this power, it can't use it again until the next dawn.</li></ul> <h4>Gargauth's Personality</h4> Gargauth desperately seeks freedom but can't escape on its own. The pit fiend won't reveal its true nature, referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord. It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape.<br><br>While trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield's current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual's soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield's owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it.<br><br>Gargauth doesn't know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it's brought to the Nine Hells, for it's convinced that the shield's powers are weaker there. <h4>Freeing Gargauth</h4> Casting Dispel Evil and Good on the shield has a 1 percent chance of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a solar, a planetar, or an archdevil. A god can release the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth's name. When released, Gargauth appears in a random, unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible.",

Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each soul coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse. <h4>Carrying Soul Coins</h4> To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it-overcome with rage or fraught with despair.<br><br>An evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of soul coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of soul coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. <h4>Using a Soul Coin</h4> A soul coin has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a soul coin and use it to do one of the following:<h5>Drain Life</h5> You siphon away some of the soul's essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.<h5>Query</h5> You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic. <h5>Freeing a Soul</h5> Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.<br><br>A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A soul coin has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon or an infernal war machine's furnace (see \"Soul Fuel\"). Freeing a soul from a soul coin is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature. <h5>Hellish Currency</h5> Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.<br><br>Soul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.",

Etched into the skull's forehead is Acererak's rune, which is known on many worlds as a sign of death. <h4>Beneficial Properties</h4> While the staff is on your person, you gain the following benefits:<ul><li>Your proficiency bonus to Intelligence (Arcana) and Intelligence (History) checks is doubled.</li><li>You can't be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, petrified, or stunned.</li><li>Undead with a challenge rating of 2 or lower will neither threaten nor attack you unless you harm them.</li><li>You can wield the staff as a +3 quarterstaff that deals an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a hit.</li></ul> <h4>Invoke Curse</h4> The Staff of the Forgotten One has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (using your spell save DC) or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the target can't regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. A Greater Restoration, Remove Curse, or similar spell ends the curse on the target. <h4>The Forgotten One</h4> The bodiless life force of a dead archmage empowers the staff and is imprisoned within it. The rune carved into the staff's skull protects Acererak from this spirit's vengeance. Each time a creature other than Acererak expends any of the staff's charges, there is a 50 percent chance that the life force tries to possess the staff wielder. The wielder must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be possessed, becoming an NPC under the DM's control. If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a Dispel Evil and Good spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the insane spirit of the dead archmage attempts to destroy the staff. <h4>Destroying the Staff</h4> A creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 132 (24d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The aboleth can't lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague. <h4>Failed Memory</h4> When your attunement to the Stone of Golorr ends, you must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A remove curse spell cast on you has a 20 percent chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a greater restoration spell does so automatically. <h4>Sentience</h4> The Stone of Golorr is a sentient lawful evil magic item with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. In addition, the aboleth learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.<br><br>The Stone of Golorr hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner. <h5>Personality</h5> The Stone of Golorr has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god. <h4>Destroying the Stone</h4> While in stone form, the aboleth isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Golorr is immune to all damage. Casting an <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=33\" class=\"spell-link\">Antipathy/Sympathy</a> spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and Golorr the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see.",

    "description": "When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it.<br><br>For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich but as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich's empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.<br><br>The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient bastard sword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead.<br><br>If the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the dominate monster spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met. <h4>Random Properties</h4> The Sword of Kas has the following random properties:<ul><li>1 minor beneficial property</li><li>1 major beneficial property</li><li>1 minor detrimental property</li><li>1 major detrimental property</li></ul> <h4>Spirit of Kas</h4> While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn. <h4>Spells</h4> While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=105\" class=\"spell-link\">Call Lightning</a>, <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=222\" class=\"spell-link\">Divine Word</a>, or <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=287\" class=\"spell-link\">Finger of Death</a>.

It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.<br><br>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. <h5>Personality</h5> The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna.

An evil creature that takes this radiant damage must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. <h4>Sentience</h4> The Sword of Zariel is a sentient, lawful good item with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet.<br><br>The sword communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it. <h4>Truth Seer</h4> While holding the sword, you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Insight) checks. <h4>Destroying the Sword</h4> Zariel can destroy the sword simply by grasping it. She couldn't bring herself to do so when she was an angel, but as an archdevil she has no compunction about ridding the multiverse of the weapon. The sword is also destroyed if it's used to shatter the Companion of Elturel, unless the blade is wielded by an angel of challenge rating 15 or higher, or a good-aligned cleric or paladin of at least 10th level.<br><br>If Zariel is killed for good (that is, if she dies in the Nine Hells), the sword becomes no harder to destroy than a normal longsword.",

    "attunementDesc": "",
    "description": "The Teeth of Dahlver-Nar are stories given form. They are a collection of teeth, each suggestive of wildly different origins and made from various materials. The collection rests within a leather pouch, stitched with images of heroes and whimsical creatures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life. <h4>Using the Teeth</h4> While you are holding the pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to determine which tooth you draw, and you can either sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are descriptionribed later). If you don't sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another implanted tooth, see below). Each tooth can only be used once. Track which teeth have been used. If a tooth's result is rolled after it's been used, you draw the next lowest unused tooth on the table. <h4>Sowing Teeth</h4> To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted. <h4>Implanting Teeth</h4> To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can't be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect. <h4>Recovering Teeth</h4> Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane. Destroying the Teeth. Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth's story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.<table><thead><tr><th>1d20</th><th>Tale and Tooth</th><th>Creatures Summoned</th><th>Implanted Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>The Staring Cats of Uldun-dar (ivory cat molar)</td><td>9 cats</td><td>The tooth has 8 charges.

When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.<br><br>Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand's presence.<br><br>Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.

The wand regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.<br><br>While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0). <h4>Call Undead</h4> While you are holding the wand, you can use an action to conjure skeletons and zombies, calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit points among, each undead having average hit points. The undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property of the wand, you can't use it again until the next dawn.<br><br>While attuned to the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The undead don't perish or disappear at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them. <h4>Sentience</h4> The Wand of Orcus is a sentient, chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.<br><br>The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common. <h5>Personality</h5> The wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor. In order to further its master's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus. <h4>Destroying the Wand</h4> Destroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life-no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.<br><br>Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss.",

    "attunementDesc": "",
    "description": "Built by dwarven gods and entrusted to the rulers of Shanatar, an ancient dwarven empire. The Wyrmskull Throne was a symbol of dwarven power and pride for ages untold. The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet-the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated.<br><br>After the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the storm giant Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership.<br><br>Any creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is paralyzed and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains paralyzed until it is separated from the throne.<br><br>Any creature seated on the throne can hear faint Whispers in Draconic-the whisperings of four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master <h4>Properties of the Throne</h4> The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Sceptor in its possession can harness the throne's properties, which are as follows:<ul><li>The throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges.</li><li>Both the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't expend any charges.</li><li>As an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=466\" class=\"spell-link\">Lightning Bolt</a> (spell save DC 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 (14d6) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls.</li><li>As an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the <a href=\"../../character-creation-resources/spell.html?spell_id=341\" class=\"spell-link\">Globe of Invulnerability</a> spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.</li><li>As an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an ancient blue dragon that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an ancient blue dragon's bite and claw attacks.</li></ul> <h4>Destroying the Throne</h4> The Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",
