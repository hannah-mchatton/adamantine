The process of the ritual involves several despicable acts including murder, the brewing of a vile concoction, and even one's own death. However, it is the process of tearing one's soul from the body that is most despised, for this process involves the sacrifice of something truly dear to a mortal, and no substitute will be accepted. For some, it is the death of a cherished loved one. For others it is a family legacy. Regardless of the sacrifice, unless the Dreadscape spirits deem it worthy, Lichdom will not be granted.",
