  <nz-tab nzTitle="Conditions">
    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-bug"></span>Attached</h5>
    <p>
      A creature that is Attached to an object or another creature is moved with
      that object or creature whenever it moves. Any effect that could be used
      to Grapple a creature can be used to Attach to a creature too large for
      the Grappler to grapple.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      Any effect that ends the Grappled condition can also end the Attached
      condition. The DC to remove an Attached creature is noted as its Remove
      DC.
    </p>
    <h6>Releasing an Attachment</h6>
    <p>
      A creature that imposes the Attached condition may end that condition as a
      bonus action.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-diabetes"></span>Bleeding</h5>
    <p>
      A Bleeding creature has an open wound, and loses the specified amount of
      hit points at the beginning of each of its turns, i.e a creature that is
      "Bleeding (1d4)" loses 1d4 hit points at the beginning of each of its
      turns.
    </p>
    <h6>Hit Point Loss</h6>
    <p>
      Hit point loss represents blood loss, and is distinct from damage. Unless
      otherwise specified, it can't be resisted or reduced in any way. It has no
      effect on creatures with 0 hit points.
    </p>
    <h6>Creatures Without Blood</h6>
    <p>
      Creatures that do not have blood or some equivalent vital fluid are immune
      to any effect that directly causes Hit Point Loss.
    </p>
    <h6>Separate Sources of Bleeding</h6>
    <p>
      If a creature that is already Bleeding would suffer a wound from a
      different source, the wound with the higher Hit Point Loss value overrides
      that with the lesser value.
    </p>
    <h6>Stacking Bleeding</h6>
    <p>
      Some effects can cause a creature to accrue multiple instances of the
      Bleeding condition, and will specify if this is the case. Stacking wounds
      of the same value count as a single instance of the Bleeding condition
      with a Hit Point Loss value equal to their total cumulative Hit Point Loss
      value.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      The Bleeding condition ends for a creature that receives any magical
      healing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, as an action, a creature may attempt a DC 12 Wisdom
      (Medicine) check to stanch the wounds of a Bleeding creature, ending the
      effect on a success.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-eye-off"></span>Blinded</h5>
    <p>
      A Blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check
      that requires sight. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and
      the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      Spells such as Lesser Restoration, Greater Restoration, and Mass Heal can
      end the Blinded condition on a creature.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-shield-remove"></span>Broken</h5>
    <p>
      A Broken creature has had its defenses rended, and has its Armor Class
      reduced by a specific amount, i.e. "Broken (-1)."
    </p>
    <h6>Separate Sources of Broken</h6>
    <p>
      If a creature that is already Broken would gain the Broken condition from
      another source, the condition with the higher Broken value overrides that
      with the lesser value.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      If a Broken creature is wearing armor, damage to that armor can be
      repaired over the course of a long rest. If a Broken creature uses natural
      armor or unarmored defense, it can be restored by any amount of magical
      healing.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-fire"></span>Burning</h5>
    <p>
      A Burning creature is on fire, and takes the specified amount of fire
      damage at the beginning of each of its turns, i.e. "Burning (1d10)."
    </p>
    <h6>Separate Sources of Burning</h6>
    <p>
      If a creature that is already Burning would gain the Burning condition
      from another source, the condition with the higher Burning value overrides
      that with the lesser value.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      The creature or a creature that can reach it may smother the flames as an
      action, ending the Burning condition for that creature. A Burning creature
      that is doused in water, that takes any cold damage, or that is in an
      airless environment, such as a bag of holding, has the condition
      immediately end for it.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-heart"></span>Charmed</h5>
    <p>
      A Charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with
      harmful abilities or magical effects, and generally treats the charmer as
      an allied creature. The charmer has advantage on any ability check to
      interact socially with the Charmed creature.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      Spells such as Greater Restoration, Dispel Good and Evil, and Power Word:
      Heal can end the Charmed condition on a creature. Charmed creatures often,
      though not always, make a saving throw to end the condition whenever they
      take damage.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-smog"></span>Choking</h5>
    <p>
      A Choking creature can't speak or breathe. Unless otherwise specified, the
      creature can hold its breath as normal.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      The Choking condition is often imposed by another ongoing effect, such as
      the Grappled or Poisoned conditions. In these instances, the Choking
      condition persists until the effect causing it ends. When a creature
      suffers the Choking condition without an ongoing effect imposing it,
      spells such as Lesser Restoration, Greater Restoration, or Power Word:
      Heal, and class features such as the Paladin's Lay On Hands ability can
      end the Choking condition on a creature.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-pentagram"></span>Cursed</h5>
    <p>
      A Cursed creature suffers the effects of the curse it is afflicted with.
      Unless specified otherwise, curses typically last until removed, and do
      not end on a creature that dies. A creature may be afflicted with multiple
      different curses simultaneously. Some curses have an additional effect
      that happens when the curse is removed.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      Spells such as Remove Curse and Greater Restoration can end one curse
      affecting a creature.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-ear-hearing-off"></span>Deafened</h5>
    <p>
      A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check
      that requires hearing.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      Spells such as Lesser Restoration, Greater Restoration, and Mass Heal can
      end the Deafened condition on a creature.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-virus"></span>Diseased</h5>
    <p>
      A Diseased creature suffers the effects of the disease it is afflicted
      with. A creature may be afflicted with multiple different diseases
      simultaneously.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      Spells such as Lesser Restoration and class features such as the Paladin's
      Lay On Hands ability can end one disease affecting a creature.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-controller-classic"></span>Dominated</h5>
    <p>
      A creature that is Dominated is Charmed and must follow the verbal or
      telepathic commands of the creature Dominating it to the best of its
      ability. If given no commands, the Dominated creature attempts to protect
      itself and the creature Dominating it. Any ability that allows a creature
      to resist or ignore the effects of the Charmed condition also applies to
      the Dominated condition.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      Any effect that ends the Charmed condition can also end the Dominated
      condition.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-emoticon-frown"></span>Frightened</h5>
    <p>
      A Frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls
      while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear. Unless
      specified otherwise, a Frightened creature does not need to flee from the
      source of its fear.
    </p>
    <h6>Line of Sight</h6>
    <p>
      A source of fear is within a Frightened creature's line of sight if an
      unobstructed line could be drawn between them, even if the Frightened
      creature cannot see it. While within the Frightened creature's Line of
      Sight, the source of fear cannot be Hidden from that creature.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      Spells such as Heroism, Calm Emotions, Beacon of Hope, Greater
      Restoration, and Power Word: Heal can end the Frightened condition on a
      creature.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-link-variant"></span>Grappled</h5>
    <p>
      A Grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus
      to its speed. The condition ends if the grappler is Incapacitated.
    </p>
    <h6>Dragging a Grappled Target</h6>
    <p>
      A creature may move a Grappled creature or object with it when it moves.
      If the Grappled creature or object is within one size category of the
      grappler, the grappler moves at half its speed when doing so.
    </p>
    <h6>Reorienting a Grapple</h6>
    <p>
      A grappler may move around a creature Grappled by it while maintaining its
      grapple, requiring no extra movement to do so.
    </p>
    <h6>Size Disparities</h6>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise stated, a creature may Grapple a creature up to one size
      larger than it. A creature at least one size larger than the creature
      grappling it may attempt to escape the Grapple as a bonus action.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      As an action, a creature may attempt to escape a Grapple, making a
      Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the Grapple's
      Escape DC. If no DC is specified, the check is instead contested by the
      grappler with a Strength (Athletics) check of its own.
    </p>
    <h6>Forced Movement and Teleportation</h6>
    <p>
      Forced movement and teleportation can break grapples. If an effect removes
      the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect,
      the grapple ends. If an effect moves the grappler to a space where it
      cannot reach the grappled creature, the grapple ends. If an effect moves
      the grappler to a space where it can still reach the grappled creature,
      the grappled creature is moved the same distance in the same direction, if
      possible.
    </p>
    <h6>Grappling a Willing Creature</h6>
    <p>
      Attempts made to Grapple a willing creature succeed automatically. A
      willing, conscious creature can be dragged with no additional movement
      cost.
    </p>
    <h6>Multiple Grapplers</h6>
    <p>
      If a creature is Grappled by multiple grapplers, each creature grappling
      it may contest the check. On a successful check, the creature is no longer
      Grappled.
    </p>
    <h6>Grappling Multiple Targets</h6>
    <p>
      A creature that is grappling one or more creatures may attempt to grapple
      another creature as long as it has an appendage available that could
      grapple that creature. A creature grappling multiple creatures suffers no
      additional penalties.
    </p>
    <h6>Releasing a Grapple</h6>
    <p>
      A creature may release a creature it has grappled with no action required
      on its turn.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-tortoise"></span>Hobbled</h5>
    <p>
      A Hobbled creature has had its mobility reduced, and has its movement
      speed reduced by a specific amount, i.e. "Hobbled (10 ft)."
    </p>
    <h6>Separate Sources of Hobbled</h6>
    <p>
      If a creature that is already Hobbled would gain the Hobbled condition
      from another source, the condition with the higher Hobbled value overrides
      that with the lesser value.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      Any effect that could end the Grappled condition, such as teleportation,
      forced movement, or spells such as Freedom of Movement, can also end the
      condition.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-account-off"></span>Incapacitated</h5>
    <p>
      An Incapacitated creature can't take actions, bonus actions, or reactions.
      It does not impose disadvantage on hostile ranged attackers within 5 feet
      of it.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-circle-opacity"></span>Invisible</h5>
    <p>
      An invisible creature impossible to see without the aid of magic or a
      special sense. The creature may hide without obscurement.
    </p>
    <h6>Detecting Invisible Targets</h6>
    <p>
      Creatures are exceptionally aware of their surroundings. A creature that
      turns Invisible is not automatically Hidden, and its position remains
      known by each creature it is not Hidden from, even if it moves, as
      creatures track its position by sound, shifting air currents, tiny visual
      clues, or by means of other senses.
    </p>
    <h6>Attacks of Opportunity</h6>
    <p>
      Attacks of Opportunity can be made only against a creature the attacker
      can see, and thus ordinarily can't be made against Invisible creatures.
    </p>
    <h6>Unseen Attackers</h6>
    <p>
      Invisible creatures are typically unseen by the creatures aroudn them.
      Attack rolls made against a creature that cannot see the attacker have
      advantage, and attack rolls made against a creature the attacker cannot
      see have disadvantage.
    </p>
    <h6>Special Senses</h6>
    <p>
      Creature with Blindsight and Truesight ignore the effects of Invisibility
      within the range of their special senses, as do creatures with Tremorsense
      if the Invisible creature and the creature with Tremorsense are in contact
      with the same contiguous surface, most commonly the ground.
    </p>
    <h6>Hiding From Creatures with Mixed Senses</h6>
    <p>
      When an Invisible creature attempts to Hide from a group of creatures that
      possess different senses, it makes a separate check without advantage to
      Hide from creatures that ignore its Invisibility.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-shimmer"></span>Paralyzed</h5>
    <p>
      A Paralyzed creature is Incapacitated, can't move or speak, and
      automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
    </p>
    <h6>Attacking Paralyzed Targets</h6>
    <p>
      Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Any attack, melee or
      ranged, that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within
      5 feet of the creature. Melee attacks made from more than 5 feet away are
      not automatic critical hits.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      Spells such as Lesser Restoration, Freedom of Movement, Greater
      Restoration, or Power Word: Heal can end the Paralyzed condition on a
      creature
    </p>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, and is unaware of
        its surroundings.
      </li>
      <li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
      <li>
        The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
      </li>
      <li>The creature has resistance to all damage.</li>

        disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      Spells such as Greater Restoration and Power Word: Heal can end the
      Paralyzed condition on a creature.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-bottle-tonic-skull"></span>Poisoned</h5>
    <p>
      A Poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

      affected or harmed by any means unless otherwise stated.
    </p>
    <h6>Possessing a Creature</h6>
    <p>
      While Possessing a creature, a spirit acts on that creature's initiative
      and in that creature's stead, using the actions, bonus actions, and
      reactions available to the creature. It may additionally use any bonus
      actions ordinarily available to it. It does not act on its own initiative.
    </p>
    <h6>Possessing an Object</h6>
    <p>
      While Possessing an object, a spirit acts on its own initiative and can
      take any action and bonus actions ordinarily available to it, but may not
      take reactions.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      In addition to any other means specific to a given spirit, the following
      means can be used to end the Possessed condition on a creature or object,
      expelling the possessing spirit into the nearest unoccupied space.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Ceremony spell may be used to perform an exorcism on a Possessed
        creature or object within 15 feet. Upon casting, the spirit must succeed
        on a Charisma saving throw against the spell caster's Save DC or be
        expelled from the Possessed creature or object.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Banishment spell may target a spirit Possessing a creature or object

      <li>
        Any effect that imposes the Turned condition affects possessing spirits
        as though they were in the space of the creature or object Possessed by
        them. A spirit that is Turned is immediately expelled from any creature
        or object it is Possessing.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Releasing a Possessed Target</h6>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise stated, a spirit may release a creature or object
      Possessed by it as an action, ending the effect. It may do so even if the
      Possessed creature is Incapacitated.
    </p>

    <h5>

        style="display: inline-block; transform: rotate(-0.2turn)"
      ></span
      >Prone
    </h5>
    <p>
      A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, which it can do at
      half its walk speed unless otherwise noted. When a flying creature falls
      Prone, it immediately falls 500 feet, then if it is still airborne the
      Prone condition ends for it.
    </p>

      may help the Prone creature to its feet as a bonus action.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-handcuffs"></span>Restrained</h5>
    <p>
      A Restrained creature's speed becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus

      it, it may regurgitate each creature Swallowed by it.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-lasso"></span>Tethered</h5>
    <p>
      A creature that is Tethered by an object or another creature cannot move outside of the reach of the ability used to tether it. Additionally, if the Tethered creature is at the maximum distance from the source of its tether, it is moved if the source moves away from it.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      Any effect that ends the Grappled condition can also end the Tethered
      condition. The DC to remove an Tethered creature is noted as its Remove
      DC.
    </p>
    <h6>Releasing a Tether</h6>
    <p>
      A creature that imposes the Tethered condition may end that condition as a
      bonus action.
    </p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-cross-celtic"></span>Turned</h5>
    <p>
      A Turned creature must spend its action and movement on each of its turns
      trying to move as far away as possible from the creature or effect that
      turned it, can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of that creature
      or effect, and can't take reactions. If there's nowhere to move, the
      creature can use the Dodge action.
    </p>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>A Turned creature that takes any damage has the condition end for it.</p>

    <h5><span class="mdi mdi-bed"></span>Unconscious</h5>
    <p>
      An unconscious creature is Incapacitated, can't move or speak, and is
      unaware of its surroundings unless specified otherwise.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A creature that falls Unconscious drops whatever it's holding and falls
        Prone.
      </li>
      <li>
        The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
      </li>
      <li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
      <li>
        Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is
        within 5 feet of the creature.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Ending the Condition</h6>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise specified, an Unconscious creature that takes any damage,
      or that has another creature shake it awake as an Action, has the
      condition end for it.
    </p>

  <nz-tab nzTitle="Diseases">
    <h5>Brittle Lung</h5>
    <p>
      Whenever an infected creature speaks or performs the verbal components of
      a spell, it must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be unable
      to speak or breathe until it takes an action to catch its breath. A
      creature that fails this save by 5 or more instead loses the ability to
      speak or breathe for 2d4 minutes.
    </p>

    <h5>Burrow-Diver Mycosis</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature loses all appetite and dusty blue lesions open on its
      skin as the disease progresses. An infected creature that attempts to move
      away from the nearest hostile creature it can see must first make a DC 10
      Wisdom saving throw, using all of its movement to approach the nearest
      hostile creature on a failure. An infected creature must succeed on a DC
      10 Constitution saving throw at each dawn or have its Wisdom score reduced
      by 1d4 until the disease is cured, ending the disease on a success. A
      creature reduced to 0 Wisdom in this way dies.
    </p>

    <h5>Cackle Fever</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can’t be removed
      until the disease is cured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any event that causes the infected creature great stress — including
      entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare —
      forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
      save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated
      with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw
      at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the
      incapacitated condition on a success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected
      creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10
      Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a
      creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that
      particular infected creature for 24 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13
      Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and
      for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the
      saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A
      creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly
      determined form of indefinite madness.
    </p>

    <h5>Chaos Phage</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is
      reduced by 10 (3d6) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces the target's
      hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a red slaad
      or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green
      slaad. Only a wish spell can reverse the transformation.
    </p>

    <h5>Charnel Lung</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature cannot hold its breath and has disadvantage on
      Constitution saving throws made to resist breathable toxins.
    </p>

    <h5>Devil Chills</h5>
    <div>
      <p>
        A creature infected with devil chills has disadvantage on saving throws
        against cold damage and against being possessed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a creature that was once afflicted with Devil Chills is reduced to
        0 hit points by cold or necrotic damage, it must succeed on a DC 14
        Constitution saving throw or have its infection return.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h5>Doll-Joint Malacia</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature loses a limb whenever it suffers a critical hit.
      Whenever an infected creature completes a Long Rest, its Strength score is
      reduced by 1d4, to a minimum of 1.
    </p>

    <h5>Festering Necrosis</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature gains vulnerability to necrotic damage. Whenever an
      infected creature would fail one death save, it instead fails two death
      Saving Throws.
    </p>

    <h5>Filth Fever</h5>
    <p>
      A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body, giving the creature
      disadvantage on skill checks, saving throws, and attack rolls that use
      Strength. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target makes a DC 15
      Constitution saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10)
      until the disease is cured on a failure, or ending the disease's effects
      on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum
      to 0.
    </p>

    <h5>Flesh Warp</h5>
    <p>
      The creature has a core of abyssal rot implanted within it, and is
      beginning to take on a demonic form determined by the DM.
    </p>
    <p>The creature regains 1 hit point on any passed death saving throw.</p>
    <p>
      Whenever the creature fails a Wisdom saving throw or is reduced to 0 hit
      points, its Charisma score is reduced by one and a portion of its flesh
      bubbles and twists, warping into a new demonic form. A creature reduced to
      0 Charisma in this way becomes a demon under the sibriex's control, and
      cannot be restored to its former self by any means short of a Wish spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      This disease resists any sort of effects that cure disease, but can be
      ended with Dispel Good and Evil, or with a DC 25 Medicine check to
      surgically remove the core of rot over the course of an hour, dealing 11
      (2d10) slashing damage to the infected creature on a success or failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Charisma reduction and physical changes wrought by the disease last
      until cured by Greater Restoration or similar magic.
    </p>

    <h5>Flitrot</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature sports festering boils, coughs up flies, and sheds
      rotting skin. The creature does not recover spent hit dice on a Long Rest,
      and makes death saving throws at disadvantage.
    </p>

    <h5>Frostbite</h5>
    <p>
      When a creature contracts frostbite, it loses the use of one of its limbs
      of its choice until this disease is cured, as the limb goes stiff and pale
      and the creature loses feeling in it. The creature cannot rest, and loses
      5 hit points at the end of each hour. This disease is cured if the
      affected limb is removed.
    </p>

    <h5>Goblin Wasp Parasitism</h5>
    <p>
      A creature infected with goblin wasp parasitism takes 3 (1d6) piercing
      damage whenever it completes a long rest, and must spend one additional
      hit die whenever it spends hit dice to heal or receive no benefit from
      that healing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a creature that has been infected for 24 hours or more dies, a Wasp
      Swarm emerges from its body.
    </p>

    <h5>Ghoul Fever</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature cannot recover levels of exhaustion, and must make a
      DC 10 Constitution saving throw each time it completes a long rest or
      acquire a level of exhaustion. A creature that dies while infected rises
      immediately as a ghoul.
    </p>

    <h5>Greensickness</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature has disadvantage on attacks, ability checks, and
      saving throws that use Strength. Tiny roots grow out of the creature's
      wounds, reducing the effect of healing magic that targets the creature by
      half.
    </p>

    <h5>Huecuva Blight</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature's blood runs clear and its skin becomes cold to the
      touch. While illuminated by moonlight, it appears waxy, hollow-eyed, and
      emaciated, and has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks and saving
      throws.
    </p>

    <h5>Jelly-Brains</h5>
    <div>
      <p>
        The creature suffers debilitating headaches, bouts of blurred vision,
        and difficulty speaking as microscopic gelatinous cubes trawl over the
        surface of its brain, slowly smoothing and resurfacing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever the creature would be reduced to 0 HP by acid damage, it
        instead takes no acid damage and has its Intelligence score reduced by
        1d8, to a minimum of 1, until cured by Greater Restoration or similar
        magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        A creature that has its Intelligence score reduced to 1 in this way
        gains the Gelatinous Endosymbiote template until cured by Greater
        Restoration or similar magic.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h6>Gelatinous Endosymbiote</h6>
    <div>
      <p>
        A gelatinous endosymbiote is a creature adapted to living inside an
        acidic ooze. It retains its statistics, except as described below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The creature's Intelligence score becomes 1.</li>
        <li>The creature has immunity to acid damage dealt by oozes.</li>
        <li>
          The creature is charmed by all oozes and other gelatinous
          endosymbiotes, and it is hostile to all other creatures.
        </li>
        <li>
          The creature is not restrained or choking while swallowed by an ooze.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h5>Leprosy</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature develops disfiguring sores and lesions across its
      body, giving it disadvantage on Charisma checks. At the end of each week
      of infection, an afflicted creature makes a DC 20 Constitution saving
      throw, ending the disease on a success or reducing its maximum hit points
      by 2d10 on a failure. A creature that has its maximum hit points reduced
      by 16 or more at once in this way loses the use of a limb. A creature that
      has its maximum hit points reduced to 0 dies.
    </p>

    <h5>Lockjaw</h5>
    <p>
      The infected creature's joints and jaw stiffen, impeding its ability to
      speak clearly. The creature's movement speed is reduced by 5, it has
      disadvantage on Charisma ability checks, and it must first succeed on a DC
      10 Constitution saving throw to perform the verbal components of a spell.
      On a failed save, the action (but not the spell slot) is wasted.
    </p>

    <h5>Lyssavirus</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at
      each dawn, or have its Constitution score reduced to the saving throw's
      result. A creature that has its Constitution score reduced to 9 or lower
      in this way is Frightened. A creature that has its Constitution score
      reduced to 0 dies.
    </p>

    <h5>Marrowrot</h5>
    <p>Attacks against an infected creature score a critical on an 18-20.</p>

    <h5>Mind Fog</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature has disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain
      Concentration. Whenever the infected creature spends 24 hours away from
      sunlight, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its
      Proficiency Bonus reduced by 1. This reduction lasts until the disease is
      cured.
    </p>

    <h5>Mummy Rot</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum
      decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If this reduces the
      target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to
      dust. The disease can be cured by a Remove Curse, in addition to any magic
      that cures disease.
    </p>

    <h5>Necrotizing Fasciitis</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature develops a festering sore at the site of a wound. At
      each dawn, an infected creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
      saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by 11 (2d10), ending
      the effect on a success. A creature that has its current hit point maximum
      reduced by more than half in this way loses the use of the limb closest to
      the wound until restored by Greater Restoration or similar magic.
    </p>

    <h5>Pestilent Lepidopterism</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature's skin develops a dry, powdery texture and it loses
      all apetite. Each dawn, the creature's Charisma score is reduced by 1, to
      a minimum of 1. A creature whose Charisma score is reduced to 1 in this
      way is enveloped in a cocoon, and over the course of a week has its body
      dissolve and reform into something new, wondrous and terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature that emerges from this cocoon has its race changed to
      Diamondback Ivathi, and cannot distinguish friend from foe. Once the
      disease has progressed to this point, curing the disease returns the
      creature's ability to distinguish friend from foe, but the mutations
      remain.
    </p>

    <h5>Pthisis</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature cannot hold its breath. Nupperibos within 1 mile of
      the creature can detect its location by scent.
    </p>

    <h5>Ravenous Wasting</h5>
    <p>
      Before an infected creature begins showing symptoms, Ravenous Wasting may
      be cured by any ordinary means, such as Lesser Restoration or Lay on
      Hands. After symptoms begin to show, it may be cured only by healing magic
      of 5th level or above, or by removing the appendage that the infection
      site occurred on. Once the symptoms have fully progressed, the disease may
      be cured only by a Wish spell, or by killing and resurrecting the
      creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every 4 hours after infection, the infected must make a DC 12 Constitution
      saving throw. On a failure, the disease progresses to the next level.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> No symptoms.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Level 2:</strong> Disadvantage on Dexterity and Wisdom checks.
        The creature has an insatiable hunger that cannot be alleviated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Level 3:</strong> Whenever the infected creature takes damage,
        it treats all non-undead creatures as hostile for the next minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Level 4:</strong> The creature convulses for 1 minute and then
        dies. After 1d4 rounds, the creature rises as a Plague Zombie.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Redding Ague</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature does not recover points of Exhaustion upon completing
      a Long Rest. Whenever an infected creature fails a Constitution saving
      throw, it acquires a point of Exhaustion.
    </p>

    <h5>Russet Mold Contagion</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature has vulnerability to Acid and Radiant damage. Upon
      completing a long rest, the creature's AC is reduced by 2 until this
      disease is cured; to a minimum of 10 if the creature is not wearing heavy
      armor, or to 14 if it is.
    </p>

    <h5>Tetanus</h5>
    <p>
      When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease,
      or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the
      disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or
      become infected.
    </p>
    <p>
      An infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only
      half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit
      points from finishing a long rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11
      Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level
      of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character's exhaustion level
      decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected
      creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the
      disease.
    </p>

    <h5>Touch of Kyuss</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature suffers from bouts of memory loss and waves of
      overwhelming nausea. Whenever the infected creature fails a saving throw
      against being Frightened or Poisoned by 5 or more, it is additionally
      Stunned until the end of its next turn. Whenever the creature fails one or
      more Death Saving Throws, its Proficiency Bonus is reduced by 1, to a
      minimum of 0, until this disease is cured.
    </p>

    <h5>Wastegash</h5>
    <p>
      Whenever an infected creature takes damage, it gains a level of
      Exhaustion. When an infected creature dies, each creature within 30 feet
      of it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be infected
      with Wastegash. This disease persists through death and resurrection, and
      be cured only through spells of 5th level or above, or equivalent magic.
    </p>

    <h5>Worms of Kyuss</h5>
    <p>
      A creature infected by one or more Worms of Kyuss takes 7 (2d6) necrotic
      damage at the end of each of its turns for each worm infesting it. A
      creature killed by this damage rises on its next turn as a Wretch of
      Kyuss. A burrowing worm may be located and destroyed with a successful DC
      14 Wisdom (Medicine) check, or by a friendly creature dealing 10 or more
      damage to the infected creature with a weapon that deals piercing damage.
      Any magical effect that cures disease destroys all worms infesting a
      creature. A creature cured of this disease must succeed on a DC 14
      Constitution saving throw or be Poisoned until it completes a Short or
      Long Rest.
    </p>

    <h5>Wraithplague</h5>
    <p>
      An infected creature has resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing
      damage, and gradually grows more translucent and quieter as the disease
      progresses. Whenever an infected creature expends one or more hit dice,
      its Charisma score is reduced by 1d4 until this disease is cured. A
      creature that has its Charisma score reduced to 0 in this way dies and
      rises as a Wraith under the DM's control
    </p>

    <div>
      <div>
        During major combat encounters, such as boss fights, it is possible for
