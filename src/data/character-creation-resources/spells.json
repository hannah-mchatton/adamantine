You then drip your blood on the spell's other components and touch them, transforming them into a special construct called a homunculus. The statistics of the homunculus are in the Monster Manual. It is your faithful companion, and it dies if you die. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can spend up to half your Hit Dice if the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as you. When you do so, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, and the homunculus's hit point maximum and current hit points are both increased by it. This process can reduce you to no lower than 1 hit point. and the change to your and the homunculus's hit points ends when you finish your next long rest. The reduction to your hit point maximum can't be removed by any means before then, except by the homunculus's death. You can have only one homunculus at a time. If you cast this spell while your homunculus lives, the spell fails."

One side has a slope with carved steps leading up, which creatures can walk up normally. The opposite side is practically a spiked wall 20 feet high.

A creature that succeeds the save takes half as much damage and can choose to either be pushed as a failed save or stay in their space and rise with the slope. If there is no room for a creature to be pushed on the far side of the slope, it is instead pushed into the nearest empty space. Additionally, when casting, you can choose any number of creatures you can see. These creatures automatically succeed on the save and take no damage rather than half.<br><br>The wall is an object with AC 12 and 80 hit points per 10-foot section lengthwise, and it is vulnerable to fire damage.

The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li></ul><ul><li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.</li></ul><ul><li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li></ul><ul><li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.</li></ul><ul><li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li></ul>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish.
