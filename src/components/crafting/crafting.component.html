    Each step will be outlined in more depth, but the following serves as a
    summary and reference for the process.

    <h6>1. Select an Item</h6>
    <div>Find the item you would like to craft on a crafting table.</div>
    <h6>2. Check with the GM</h6>
    <div>
      They will confirm if that item exists and has the default rarity in their
      game. This system is a tool, it does not supersede worldbuilding.
    </div>
    <h6>3. Gather the Materials</h6>
    <div>
      Materials can be looted from humanoids, harvested from more exotic
      creature types, purchased at stores, or gathered from the wilderness. The
      specifics of any material and where it can be found is covered in the
      materials section.
    </div>
    <h6>4. Begin Crafting</h6>
    <div>
      You can find the related tool and ability score on the table below. Use
      the related tool and skill to determine your crafting modifier.

      <ul>
        <li>
          You can make progress in 2 hour increments. For each 2 hours spent,
          make a crafting roll using the formula above and compare the result to
          the DC listed for the item.
        </li>
        <li>
          On a failure, no progress is made. If you fail three times in a row,
          the crafting fails and all materials are lost.
        </li>
        <li>
          On a success, 2 hours of progress is made, and you can mark your
          progress put it aside or continue to craft.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once your completed progress on an item is equal to the crafting time
          listed, the item is complete.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <nz-tabset nzSize="small" [nzAnimated]="false">
      <nz-tab nzTitle="Crafting Time">
        <div>
          <div>
            All items have a crafting time measured in hours. Crafting is
            completed in 2 hour chunks. Some branches of crafting must make all
            their checks consecutively (like Alchemy) while some do not (like
            Blacksmithing or Enchanting). A crafting roll is made every 2 hours
            of work on an item.
          </div>
          <div>
            On a success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed
            time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete. On a
            failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made
            during the 2 hours.
          </div>
          <div>
            If you fail three times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all
            materials are lost.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>Crafting During a Rest</h5>
        <div>
          <div>
            During a long rest, you can make up to 2 hours of progress during a
            crafting project if you do nothing else during the long rest besides
            craft and sleep. During this time, you have disadvantage on any
            Wisdom (Perception) checks and a -5 to all Passive Perception checks
            as you are focused on your craft.
          </div>
          <div>
            If you do not have to rest, such as is the case with thri-kreen, you
            can make up to 8 hours of progress during a long rest. You make four
            checks, one for each two hour increment.
          </div>
          <div>
            For most projects, this progress can be banked completing the
            project 2 hours at a time. For some types of crafting, like alchemy,
            you can't make incremental progress, but you can continue for 2
            additional hours of crafting before or after a long rest in which
            you crafted to get 4 hours (for example).
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>Crafting Rolls</h5>
        <div>
          <div>
            Each profession lists the related ability modifier and tool used to
            calculate your crafting roll modifier. In many cases, attempting to
            craft without the applicable tool is impossible. Your GM may allow
            improvised tools, and in that case the check is made with
            disadvantage.
          </div>
          <div>
            Beyond the tool, most branches of crafting require a heat source,
            and some require more infastructure. These are generally approached
            logically and are at the discretion of the GM. For an adventurer
            looking for more portable workshop tools, investigate the Crafting
            Magic Spells and Crafting Utility Magic Items sections; these offer
            additional avenues for increased portability.
          </div>
          <div>
            Here is a list of some of the additional requirements by branch:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Blacksmithing can perform minor crafts with a simple heat
                source, but requires a forge and anvil to make new items.
              </li>
              <li>Alchemy and Cooking almost always requires a heat source.</li>
              <li>
                Tinkering, Jewelcrafting, and Poisoncraft sometimes require a
                heat source.
              </li>
              <li>
                Enchanting, Scribing, Woodworking, Whittling, Poisoncraft,
                Leatherworking, Engineering, Runecarving rarely require anything
                besides the tools of the profession.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h6>Expertise</h6>
          <div>
            Features that grant tool expertise (the ability to add twice your
            proficiency bonus to ability checks made with a tool) are calculated
            into your crafting roll modifier, but do not add to an the
            calculated DC the effects of that item have.
          </div>

          <h6>Bonuses</h6>
          <div>
            <div>
              A crafting roll is a special type of ability check and you can't
              add temporary bonuses to your roll (such as Bardic Inspiration or
              the guidance spell) as the crafting roll represents the entire
              time you spend working the item.
            </div>
            <div>
              In general, the intention is that no external bonuses apply,
              unless they specifically state they do. This would include feats
              (such as ones that allow you to reroll certain rolls), class
              features (such as ones that allows you to add dice to certain
              rolls), etc.
            </div>
            <div>
              You can gain can advantage if another player with proficiency in
              the related tool helps for the whole crafting time.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h6>Taking 10</h6>
          <div>
            <div>
              When you craft something, double the crafting period (from 2 hours
              to 4 hours per check) to "take a 10" on the crafting roll, meaning
              that your crafting checks are 10 + your modifier. This provides a
              floor level that you can always succeed on if you choose to take
              your time.
            </div>
            <div>
              If someone with proficiency is aiding you for the entire duration
              of the crafting, the crafting check doesn't gain any bonus, but
              can be completed in the standard 2 hours.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h6>Workdays</h6>
          <div>
            <div>
              When a character is spending all day working, they make 8 hours of
              progress, and cannot exceed 8 hours working on a crafting project
              during a day. Players will occasionally want to work longer than 8
              hours, but this fails to account for the limitations of mortals:
              player characters still need to eat, sleep, and will eventually
              lose their focus and ability to work. This is primarily
              implemented for balance reasons, but also helps model how much
              productive time a character can spend; they are not just working 8
              hours straight and idling for 8 hours, but rather a model of the
              natural flow of a day, taking breaks, etc.
            </div>
            <div>
              A GM can choose to overrule this and allow extreme crafting days
              in special circumstances, but in almost all cases working over 8
              hours on a crafting project would leave a character with one or
              more levels of Exhaustion.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </nz-tab>
      <nz-tab nzTitle="Valuable Gear">
        <div>
          <div>
            In some cases, you may want to make something that is more valuable.
            While selling more valuable gear may be quite difficult, as is often
            said, magic has expensive tastes. Many magic items that an Enchanter
            might want require items of a certain value.
          </div>
          <div>
            Here's some examples of specific modifiers you can add to increase
            the value of an item:

            <table>
              <tr>
                <th>Modifier</th>
                <th>Materials</th>
                <th>DC</th>
                <th>Value Added</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Bejeweled</td>
                <td>One or more gemstones</td>
                <td>+1 per gemstone</td>
                <td>Total value of all gemstones</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Gilded</td>
                <td>10 gold scraps</td>
                <td>+2</td>
                <td>+20 gp</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>

          <div>
            Additionally, you can generally increase the value of an item simply
            by making it more ornate and exercising greater craftsmanship. You
            can, when you start crafting an item, raise the DC and/or crafting
            time of that item artificially. When you do so, that items value is
            recalculated.
          </div>
        </div>
      </nz-tab>
    </nz-tabset>
  </nz-tab>
  <nz-tab nzTitle="Crafting Materials">
    <div>
      Without materials, there is nothing to craft from. Crafting does not make
      things from thin air, it makes more useful things from less useful things.
      Gathering the materials will be the essential first step in any job.
      Materials are generally found in three ways.
    </div>
    <h6>Loot & Salvaging</h6>
    <div>
      Nothing is useless when you have a party of crafters. One of the main
      sources of materials will be the things you find. Nothing is useless when
      you have an expert craftsman in the party
    </div>

    <h6>Gathering & Harvesting</h6>
    <div>
      How something is gathered varies on the profession; in many cases, it can
      only be gathered when the opportunity arises. Dragon scales, for example,
      are a lot easier to gather when there is a dead dragon nearby. Be it
      harvesting rare herbs, monster parts, or minerals, gathering is an
      opportunity you won't want to pass up.
    </div>

    <h6>Purchasing</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        Rarely will everything you need to craft what you want fall into you
        hands without the assistance of the oldest and most powerful tool of any
        craftsman: money. When you don't have what you need, frequently you can
        buy it. For some professions, there will be a lot more materials that
        can be purchased, while others will rely more on the other routes.
      </div>
      <div>
        In general, the buying price of a material is its listed value, and its
        selling price is usually half of that to an interested property.
      </div>
      <div>
        Between negotiation, market fluctuation, and GM moods, you may get
        better or worse prices. Note that many materials are simply junk to a
        party that does not have a use for them, and will only sell to
        interested parties that can use or resell them.
      </div>
      <div>
        Threatening to burn down a merchant's shop because they will not offer
        you the listed price may result in an Intimidation check, but does not
        change market realities and is typically not beneficial to your
        reputation; most merchants that have the gold to buy and sell expensive
        materials have dealt with adventurers before and are not easily
        intimidated.
      </div>
    </div>

    <nz-tabset nzSize="small" [nzAnimated]="false">
      <nz-tab nzTitle="Essences">
        <div>
          <div>
            While reagents are substances that contain a glimmer of magical
            power that can be harnessed through refinement, Essences are more
            purified forms of magical power. These come in five types: Arcane,
            Divine, Occult, Primal, and Psionic as well as in the five normal
            rarities (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary). These
            essences are the pure stuff of magic that makes things work.
          </div>
          <div>
            You can get these by rendering down magical reagents, salvaging
            magic items, harvesting them from magical monsters, or through the
            hard work of spell casters. Or you can find them as loot from people
            that have already done one of those harder steps. The rules for
            rendering them down from materials are contained within each branch
            of crafting, while the rules for creating them yourself are under
            Enchanting, as it is their domain and skill set needed to do so.
          </div>
          <div>
            While all branches occasionally use essences when extra magical
            power is needed, they are the primary material of Enchanters, and
            their pricing can be found in that section.
          </div>
          <div>
            Essences can be found as loot during the courses of your adventures,
            but can also be harvested (from monsters), salvaged (from magical
            equipment), synthesized (from reagents), or created from the raw
            power of a spell caster, though the method is long and arduous.
          </div>
          <div>
            Essences are flexible in their exact nature. There are many paths to
            each desired outcome, and this flexibility is represented in
            Essences. While the traditional way to make a belt of hill giant
            strength may call for a hill giant heart as its essence, an
            enchanter may substitute a dragon heart as their primal essences to
            make a belt of dragon strength that just has the same statistical
            effect.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h6>Creating Essences</h6>
        <div>
          <div>
            Another potential source of an Essence is being created by a
            spellcaster. This process is long and arduous, and typically only
            suited to downtime. A creature with the spell casting feature can
            create 1 essence during 1 workweek (5 days, 8 hours a day); this
            process can't be completed faster and for the duration they are
            considered to have spent all of their spell slots
          </div>
          <div>
            At 1st level or higher can make a common essence in this way, a
            caster 5th level or higher can make an uncommon essence this way, a
            caster at 11th level can make a rare essence in this way, and a
            caster at 17th level or higher can make a very rare essence this
            way. Legendary essences require special rituals, more casters, and
            take far longer; they are exceedingly hard to make.
          </div>
          <div>
            The type of essence produced depends on which spell lists you have
            access to. Those who have access to the Melodic spell list can make
            Arcane essences, and Artificers can make any type of essence.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h6>Salvaging Essences</h6>
        <div>
          <div>
            You also may be able to salvage magical essence from unwanted or
            broken magical items, though such a reclamation process can be
            difficult, and rarely results in more than a fraction of the essence
            infused into the original item. An item returns one essence equal to
            its rarity when harvested. The process takes 2 hours to complete,
            and doesn't work if the item is currently attuned to any creature.
            An essence can only be salvaged from permanent magic items; a
            permanent magic item is one that recharges or doesn't have a
            limitation on its charges or uses. A magic item with charges or uses
            can only be salvaged while it is at full charges or uses.
          </div>
          <div>
            The item becomes nonmagical after the essence is salvaged from it.
            If it required magic to function or exist, it is destroyed.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h6>Synthesizing Essences</h6>
        <div>
          <div>
            In addition to harvesting essences from magical monsters fully
            intact, a more approachable and incremental way is to combine
            several reagents to get an essence. You have to combine three
            reagents of the same rarity to gain one essence of that rarity. You
            can combine reagents in the following ways. This process takes 4
            hours, and requires alchemist's supplies and a heat source.

        <div>
          <div>
            Hides, scales, and carapaces all tend to be harvested from monsters.
            Leather is a product of hides that can be processed from what it is
            harvested from the monster.
          </div>
          <div>
            The GM determines if a monster provides hide, scale, or carapace.
            Hides do not come in different sizes, rather larger creatures simply
            provide more hides, and monsters that are not large enough to
            produce one hide provide only hide scraps.
          </div>
          <div>
            Scales are likewise abstracted: each increment is simply an
            arbitrary unit of scales that the unit of scales covers. Scales can
            be much larger or small from different-sized creatures.
          </div>
          <div>
            Creatures are harvested using a Survival check, with its DC listed
            below. If the DC check is failed, the harvest does not fail
            entirely, but instead they get 1d4 hide scrapes in place of any
            hides, carapaces of one size smaller, and half as many scales.

      <nz-tab nzTitle="Ingots">
        <div>Ingots are chunks of metal that can be used to craft things.</div>
        <h6>Salvaging Ingots</h6>
        <div>
          Metal items can be converted back to ingots quite efficiently, but
          require a forge to do so. With a forge and 2 hours per item, a metal
          item can be rendered down into its component ingots. Advanced metals
          may require special tools to smelt.
        </div>
        <h6>Smelting Ore</h6>
        <div>
          Creating ingots from raw ore is largely out of scope for most
          adventurers, but you can create ingots from raw ore with a suitable
          facility. For more details see the Components and Materials table
          under Blacksmithing.
        </div>
      </nz-tab>
      <nz-tab nzTitle="Magical Ink">
        <div>
          <div>
            While ink has many uses, crafting is mostly concerned with magical
            ink which has the power to hold the arcane words of scrolls. This is
            synthesized by alchemists from the magical properties of reagents,
            as it is concerned with extracting their magical properties, the
            exact nature of the reagents used do not effect the final ink beyond
            its potency.
          </div>
          <div>
            Magical ink is not typically found or harvested on its own, though
            it may be found as loot, and in some instances a GM could rule that
            some blood collected from a fiend, celestial or dragon could be
            counted as such. It is generally created from reagents or purchased
            from alchemists that create it from reagents.
          </div>
          <div>
            Magical ink can't be salvaged once they have been combined into
            another form (such as potions, essences, or ink).
          </div>
        </div>
      </nz-tab>
      <nz-tab nzTitle="Parts">
        <div>
          <div>
            The term “parts” is used to refer to gears, wires, springs, windy
            bits, screws, nails, and doodads. Parts can be either found or
            salvaged or forged from metal scraps (or even straight from ingots
            by a Blacksmith for those that really want to be industrial about
            it). The exact nature of each item making up this collection is left
            abstracted.
          </div>
          <div>
            In addition, metal scraps are collections of salvaged material that
            generally fall into the category of things “too small to track”
            which can then be used for the creations of tinkerers. In addition
            to all of this, occasionally tinkers will use ingots... particularly
            ones of tin (which is their namesake, after all).
          </div>
          <div>
            Like other crafting branches, there are also named components for
            more iconic pieces of gear—the stock of a crossbow, for example, or
            other items. The cost for these items can be found on the common
            component table, and are generally minor.
          </div>
          <div>
            Lastly, Tinkerers use essences when constructing things that push
            beyond the mundane principles of plausibility, crafting magical
            properties into their inventions.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h6>Salvaging Parts</h6>
        <div>
          The other main way to acquire parts is to salvage them. What can be
          salvaged is determined by the GM, but in general common items provide
          parts, uncommon or expensive items may provide fancy parts, and
          esoteric parts are found only from esoteric sources at your GM's
          discretion. Tools, vehicles, and complex items generally return 1d4
          metal scraps and 1d4 parts for a Small or smaller item, 2d6 metal
          scraps for a Medium-sized item, 3d8 metal scraps for a Large-sized
          item, and more for larger items, though they may return less of rare
          types of parts.
        </div>
      </nz-tab>
      <nz-tab nzTitle="Reagents">
        <div>
          <div>
            Reagents are a huge range of things; most often they are plants that
            contain some magical essence, but almost as frequently they are
            harvested from various magically inclined monsters. The exact source
            of a reagent usually does not matter beyond defining its type, as
            the part of the reagent used is the fragment of magic contained
            within that is distilled out.
          </div>
          <div>
            There are many different ways to make a potion. Consequently, the
            materials are sorted into categories. These categories include
            curative, reactive, and poisonous. These each come in the standard
            material rarities: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary.
          </div>
          <div>
            Reagents can't be salvaged once they have been combined into another
            form (such as potions, essences, or ink).
          </div>
        </div>
      </nz-tab>
      <nz-tab nzTitle="Wood">
        <div>
          Commonly available in its lowest quality (firewood), higher quality
          woods are often found in rather exotic locations. Wooden branches
          (including wood scraps) are assumed to be of a useful wood that can be
          worked, while firewood covers everything else, with more useful woods
          falling into categories such as quality or rarer options. Wood scraps
          are assumed to be scraps of common branch quality wood, and
          consequently can't be salvaged from firewood.
        </div>
        <h6>Salvaging Wood</h6>
        <div>
          <div>
            For the most part, wood can't be easily salvaged. Wood carving is
            not necessarily a reversible process, and wood can't be smelted
            down.
          </div>
          <div>
            You can render wooden crafted product into wood scraps equal to 4 x
            the number of branches used to create it.

  <nz-tab nzTitle="Alchemy">
    <div>
      <div>
        Alchemy is a crafting art that almost all adventures have some degree of
        interest in the results of. The source of the ever in demand Potion of
        Healings, it is a versatile trade that fuels (sometimes quite literally)
        the adventuring life.
      </div>
      <div>
        It doesn't take many experiences with the powers of potions for an
        adventurer to consider if they can get away with simmering a Potion of
        Healing next to the stew over that night's cooking fire... of course
        it's easier said than done for the result of such things to come away
        not poisonous.
      </div>
      <div>
        Alchemy tends to be a very quick form of crafting, but with this comes
        additional risks with most crafts resting on a single roll, and failure
        resulting in the loss of all materials. Although taking that chance is
        frequently worth it during a busy adventuring season, consider the
        "Taking 10" option outlined in the craft introduction when speed is not
        of the essence.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h5>Related Tool</h5>
    <div>
      <div>
        Alchemy works using alchemist's supplies. Attempting to craft a potion
        without these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and
        proficiency with these allows you to add your proficiency to any alchemy
        crafting roll.
      </div>
      <div>Alchemy uses your Intelligence modifier.</div>
    </div>

    <h5>Shelf Life</h5>
    <div>
      A unique attribute to alchemy, potions once crafted have a shelf life of 1
      year before coming expired. This shelf life is shortened to 1 month if the
      potion contains any reactive ingredient.
    </div>
    <h6>Expired Potions</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        If an expired potion is used or consumed within double its shelf life,
        roll a d4. On a 1, you become poisoned for 1 minute. On a 2 or 3, the
        potion will work with reduced effect; its duration will be halved if it
        had a duration, and damage or healing it dealt will be halved. On a 4,
        it works as expected.
      </div>
      <div>
        Any potion that is older than twice its shelf life has no effect besides
        causing the imbiber to become poisoned for 1 minute.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h5>Crafting Roll</h5>
    <div>
      <div>
        Putting that together means that when you want to work on Alchemy, your
        crafting roll is as follows:
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Alchemy Modifier = </strong> your Alchemist's Supplies modifier
      </div>
    </div>
    <h6>Success and Failure</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        For Alchemy, after you make the crafting roll and succeed mark your
        progress on a crafting project. If you succeed, you make 2 hours of
        progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the
        required checks for making an item). Checks for Alchemy must be
        consecutive, meaning that if you wish to continue after a failed craft,
        you need to extend your crafting time.
      </div>
      <div>
        Failure means that no progress is made during that time. Once an item is
        started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that
        item can only be recovered via salvage. If you fail three times in a
        row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h5>Alchemy Saving Throw</h5>
    <div>
      <div>
        Some alchemical creations trigger a saving throw. In instances that they
        do, the following is the formula for calculating the saving throw. The
        saving throw is calculated at the time of creation based on the creators
        attributes and proficiency, and doesn't change once it is created.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Alchemy DC = </strong> 8 + your Alchemist's Supplies modifier
      </div>
    </div>

    <h5>Herbalist's Limited Alchemy</h5>
    <div>
      <div>
        While herbalism is primarily used for gathering herbs, a creature with
        proficiency with herbalism kits has a limited proficiency in creating
        potions in addition to gathering herbs. You can use proficiency with an
        herbalism kit in place of alchemist's supplies when creating potions of
        healing, antidotes, antitoxins, and vials of poison.
      </div>
      <div>
        When crafting in this way, you use an herbalism kit and proficiency with
        it in place of alchemist's supplies, and you use your Wisdom modifier in
        place of your Intelligence modifier. This crafting otherwise works the
        same as using alchemist's supplies.
      </div>
      <div>
        You can add additional reagent modifiers when crafting in this way.

        You can simply load more reagents into any potion, increasing its
        potency in different ways, though it increases the difficulty. You can
        make a "custom potion" simply by using these modifiers with no base
        potion. When you do so, the base DC is 8.

  <nz-tab nzTitle="Blacksmithing">
    <div>
      <div>
        Blacksmithing is a popular professional interest of two sorts of
        adventurers: those that want to hit things with heavy metal objects, and
        those that want a heavy metal object between them and the thing hitting
        them
      </div>
      <div>
        While often relying on the town blacksmith to do their work for them is
        a fine option, rolling up your sleeves and doing the work yourself can
        allow you to express your creativity... and may save you a few coins in
        the process.
      </div>
      <div>
        Blacksmithing is slow hard work, but has a higher tolerance for failure
        than most, and is more dependent on knowing your material, as the
        templates you work from tend to be common across many of them.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h5>Related Tool</h5>
    <div>
      <div>
        Blacksmithing works using blacksmith's tools. Attempting to craft an
        item without blacksmith's tools will often be impossible, though a GM
        may let you use makeshift tools to make a check with disadvantage.
        Proficiency in blacksmith's tools allows you to add your proficiency
        bonus to any blacksmithing check.
      </div>
      <div>
        While Blacksmiths can benefit from their skills in small ways such as
        sharpening their weapons and retrofitting their gear on the go, many of
        their crafting options require a fully equipped Forge; a fully equipped
        Forge entails a forge, anvil, and blacksmith's tools.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h5>Magical Forges</h5>
    <div>
      The worlds of the planar multiverse are a fantastical place with many
      wonders. Sometimes you may find locations that have been constructed in
      such a way as to leverage powerful primal powers in the forging technique:
      for example, a forge at the heart of a volcano or atop an ever-frozen
      glacier, which might imbue items crafted there with special properties.
    </div>

    <h5>Crafting Roll</h5>
    <div>
      <div>
        Putting that together means that when you would like to smith an item,
        your crafting roll is as follows:
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Blacksmithing Modifier =</strong> your Blacksmith's Tools
        modifier
      </div>
    </div>

    <h6>Success and Failure</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        After you make a crafting roll, if you succeed, you make 2 hours of
        progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the
        required checks for making an item).
      </div>
      <div>
        Checks for Blacksmithing do not need to be immediately consecutive. If
        you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and
        can no longer be salvaged. Failure means that no progress is made during
        that time.
      </div>
      <div>
        Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components
        reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h5>Maintenance & Modifications</h5>
    <div>
      <div>
        While the primary purpose of Blacksmithing is to forge armor and weapons
        from metal, for an adventurer such events are important milestones that
        generally will not occur everyday. The following are some tasks that
        require proficiency with Blacksmith's Tools that provide a more
        day-to-day utility to the proficiency, giving them minor ways to enhance
        or adapt their gear.
      </div>
      <div>
        These are minor crafts can be completed in 2 hours with the expenditure
        of 5 gp worth of materials. They can be done as part of a long rest, but
        have limitations the normally crafted items do not (such as a maximum
        stockpile of minor crafts).
      </div>
      <div>The following are "minor crafting options" for Blacksmiths:</div>
    </div>
    <h6>Maintain Gear</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        One of the perks of having a blacksmith in the field is their ability to
        keep gear in its best condition, giving you an edge (sometimes
        literally) in the quality of your gear and weapons. Over the course of 2
        hours, a Blacksmith can maintain a number of weapons or sets of armor
        equal to their proficiency bonus, granting each weapon or armor
        maintained a special d6 Quality Die.
      </div>
      <div>
        For a weapon, this can be rolled and added to an attack or damage roll,
        representing a case where the perfect state of the gear turned a miss
        into a hit or dealt a bit of extra damage. For a set of armor, the die
        can be rolled when hit by an attack, and the damage taken from that
        attack can be reduced by that amount.
      </div>
      <div>
        Rolling this die doesn't require an action, but once rolled it is spent
        and can't be regained until the blacksmith maintains that armor or
        weapon again.
      </div>
    </div>
    <h6>Modify Armor</h6>
    <div>
      While the field crafting of armor is often not possible, you can make
      smaller adjustments on the go. Over the course of 2 hours, you can turn a
      set of plate mail into a half plate or a breastplate, refit a set of heavy
      or medium armor to fit another user that is equal in size or smaller than
      the original user.
    </div>
    <h6>Modify Weapon</h6>
    <div>
      Every adventure has slightly different preferences in their gear, and your
      skills allow you make slight modifications to nonmagical weapons made of
      metal. These modifications take 2 hours, require a heat source, and
      require you to pass a DC 14 blacksmithing check (on failure, the weapon is
      damaged and has a -1 penalty to its attack rolls until fixed). You can
      perform one of the following modifications:

      <ul>
        <li>
          You can weight a weapon, giving it the heavy property. If it did not
          already have the two-handed property, it gains the two-handed
          property.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can remove the heavy property from a weapon, reducing its damage
          dice by one step.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can add the light property to a weapon without the heavy property,
          reducing its damage dice by one step.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can silver the weapon (requires 5 silver scraps for one-handed
          weapons, 10 for two-handed weapons, and 15 for massive weapons).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h6>Repair Gear</h6>
    <div>
      Sometime in the course of adventuring, weapons or armor will become
      severely damaged, suffering a penalty to its attack rolls or AC. Over the
      course of 2 hours, you can repair this damage, though at the discretion of
      the GM you may need other materials to perform this task if it is heavily
      damaged. Weapons that are entirely broken (such as a snapped sword) are
      generally beyond simple repair.

        Masterwork: Failing a crafting roll for Masterwork doesn't cause a
        failure, but the resulting weapon is only a Masterwork if all crafting
        rolls that succeed pass the DC of Masterwork. An item is automatically
        masterwork if every roll qualified for a Masterwork version.

    <div>
      <div>
        Adventures need to eat. While some are content to eat the same stale old
        rations, some prefer to apply their skills to be kept well fed... even
        in the depths of a dungeon where fresh ingredients can be... strange.
      </div>
      <div>
        Not only can someone with talent produce tasty treats, but being well
        fed can have a variety of benefits... particularly when eating correctly
        prepared magical ingredients.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h5>Related Tool & Ability Score</h5>
    <div>
      Cooking works using cook's utensils. Attempting to craft a meal without
      these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with
      these allows you to add your proficiency to any cooking crafting roll.
      Cooking uses your Wisdom modifier.
    </div>

    <h5>Duration</h5>
    <div>
      The duration a meal remains edible depends on the type of meal made. A
      feast must be consumed within an hour, a snack lasts for 1 day, and
      rations lasts 1 month.
    </div>

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <div>
      The materials for cooking are fresh ingredients and supplies. A fresh
      ingredient is something you harvest that can increase the quality of your
      food and sometimes provide supernatural boosts beyond mere satiation.
      Staples include seasonings, spices, flour or even turnips! Foods that last
      awhile can be cooked into perfectly fine meals, but have less benefits
      than eating a good meal. Some ingredients additionally have the exotic
      property, and may confer special effects.
    </div>

    <h6>Ingredient Expiration</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        Normal Ingredients expire very quickly, and must be used within 24 hours
        of being harvested or they become unusable. Preserved rations would fall
        into the staples category and cannot typically be used to cook anything
        besides basic meals.
      </div>
      <div>
        The ability to gain any sort of magical benefit is linked to its
        freshness; even well prepared preserved foods provide only the benefit
        of a Basic Meal (which is a satisfying and good tasting meal, but its
        benefits are not otherwise magical).
      </div>
      <div>
        Unlike Fresh Ingredients, Staples last significantly longer and do not
        need to have their expiration tracked for the purposes of this system.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h6>Satiation</h6>
    <div>
      The magical benefits you get consuming rare and magical foods cannot be
      gained again until 24 hours have passed for any particular food. When
      combined with the ingredient expiration above, this typically means that
      any ingredient collected is only good for a single meal; this is
      intentional. You can harvest more if you wish, but cooking naturally is a
      profession of fleeting achievement and fickle opportunity.
    </div>

    <h5>Crafting Roll</h5>
    <div>
      <div>
        Putting that together means that when you would like to create a meal,
        your crafting roll is as follows:
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Cooking Modifier =</strong> your Cook's Utensils modifier
      </div>
      <h6>Success and Failure</h6>
      <div>
        For cooking, all crafting rolls must be made consequetively. Make all
        checks listed for the items. If you succeed a greater number of times
        than you fail, the meal is successfully completed, otherwise, it is
        inedible and all ingrediants are lost.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h5>Exotic Ingredients</h5>
    <div>
      <div>
        While standard meals are made from a selection of ingredient types and
        generally a seasoning, exotic ingredients have specialized effects. When
        making a meal from these ingredients, the meal's effect is a combination
        of the effect of the exotic ingredients added.
      </div>
      <div>
        An Exotic Meal (meal cooked entirely from exotic ingredients) doesn't
        need a recipe and has a crafting time of 1 hour, and the difficulty is
        the difficulty of all the exotic ingredients added together, with 1
        check needed per exotic ingredient added.
      </div>
      <div>
        Exotic ingredients can be combined with a standard meal by adding the DC
        of the standard meal to the combined difficulty of the exotic
        ingredients added. This can cause unusual meals and frequently has
        unattainably high difficulty to make it work, as adding random new
        components to meals typically wrecks the taste.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h5>Basic Cooking</h5>
    <div>
      <div>
        While the rules present a handful of ways to use cooking for more exotic
        ends, the most common application of cooking is just to produce an
        edible meal during a long rest—something any adventuring group would
        welcome. This is called a Quality Meal and provides greater benefit than
        rations, though the benefits it provides are not magical, and merely
        stem from it being a satisfying meal. You can do so by expending 1 fresh
        ingredient of any type and 1 common supplies to feed up to 5 allies or
        willing creatures, or by spending common supplies per creature being
        cooked for. These materials must have been purchased within the last
        week. Any creature, even one not proficient with cook's utensils can
        take this action.
      </div>
      <div>
        You and all willing creatures (willing to eat your cooking) regain an
        additional Hit Die (up to their maximum). If you have proficiency with
        cook's utensils, creatures regain additional Hit Dice equal to your
        Proficiency bonus.

        <h6>Common Feast</h6>
        <div>
          <div>
            Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being
            prepared. After consuming this hearty meal, you become satiated for
            the next 24 hours. This is a hearty meal well surpassing the
            benefits of normal meals or rations, and each creature that consumes
            it regains an additional Hit Die during the next long rest.
          </div>
          <div>
            If cooked by a creature with proficiency in cook's utensils,
            creatures that consume this feast regain additional Hit Dice equal
            to the cook's proficiency bonus during the next long rest instead.

        <h6>Uncommon Feast</h6>

          <div>
            Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being
            prepared. After consuming this hearty meal, you become satiated for
            the next 24 hours. You gain the benefits for a common feast, but can
            gain additional benefits by trading in Hit Dice that would be gained
            as part of your next long rest after consuming this meal. These Hit
            Dice are consumed after calculating how many you would have after
            the rest (including the benefits of the feast), but you can trade
            Hit Dice in this way you would normally lose if you have more than
            your maximum Hit Dice.
          </div>
          <div>
            You can trade Hit Dice in this way up to a number equal to your
            proficiency bonus. The benefits scale based on the rarity on the
            feast.

          <div>
            Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being

            the next 24 hours. Consuming the essence of a properly prepared
            creature of great power confers some of its power to you while
            satiated by the feast.
          </div>
          <div>
            You can add +1/+2/+3/+4 to ability checks and saving throws of the
            prepared creatures highest stat (if multiple stats are tied, the
            cook chooses which when preparing the meal). Alternatively, the cook
            can bring forth exotic properties of the creature, conferring one
            trait of the cooked animal to those that consume it as per the
            following table (this replaces the benefit to ability checks and
            saves):

            The details from the creature boon can be found on the creature stat
            block. The cook must be aware of the creature's property to make the
            meal imbue that property, and the GM may adjust the property in
            cases where it would not work for players or be too powerful as
            written. At the GM's discretion, any ability can be added to this
            list.

              You can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 10
              feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw,
              taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on

            action. While being chewed (for up to 10 minutes), you are energized
            and can ignore the effects of up to 3 levels of Exhaustion for the
            duration, and can't be put to sleep by magical means.
          </div>
          <div>
            You can only gain this benefit once per day, after which consuming
            additional pieces of the candy has no effect until you finish a long
            rest.

        </div>
        <h6>Morph Cookies</h6>
        <div>
          <div>
            Consuming one of these has the effects of casting alter self,
            however you can't change the adaptation unless you consume another
            cookie. This effect doesn't require concentration to maintain, and
            can be extended by consuming an additional morph cookie.
          </div>
          <div>
            If the ingredient came from a mimic, you can additionally transform
            your appearance to creatures with a different basic shape than you,

            saving throws against Illusion spells, and Intelligence
            (Investigation) checks to see through illusions, though because of
            the bad taste inherent to the formulation, continuing to suck on the
            seeing stick requires concentration, as if concentrating on a spell.
          </div>

            sweetened, granting you advantage on Constitution saving throws made
