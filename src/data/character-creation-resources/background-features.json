    "name": "Abnormal Demeanor",
    "description": "You were raised by monsters of some sort.  Work with your GM to determine what raised you and what changes this has upon your personality and mannerisms.  Your time with your adopted parents taught you an entire lexicon of habits, behaviors, and intuitions suited to life in the wild among creatures of your parents' type. When you are in the same type of terrain your adopted parent inhabits, you can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five other people each day.</p><p>In addition, when you encounter a creature like your adopted parent or parents, the creature is disposed to hear your words instead of leaping directly into battle. Mindless or simple creatures might not respond to your overtures, but more intelligent creatures may be willing to treat instead of fight, if you approach them in an appropriate manner. For example, if your adopted parent was a cloaker, when you encounter a cloaker years later, you understand the appropriate words, body language, and motions for approaching the cloaker respectfully and peacefully."
