<h5>No Dead Dogs</h5>
<p>
  If a character so chooses, they can purchase or train a variety of animals as
  pets. If these pets are not used in combat, they are functionally invincible
  for the duration of the campaign.

<h5>Taking 10</h5>
<p>
  When your character is not in immediate danger or distracted, you may choose
  to take 10. Instead of rolling a d20 for a skill check, calculate your result
  as if you had rolled a 10.
