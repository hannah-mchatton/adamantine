Aasimar are born to serve as champions of the gods, their births hailed as blessed events. They are a people of otherworldly visages, with luminous features that reveal their celestial heritage. An aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an angelic being. That being - usually a deva - provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings.",

An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin's current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.",

Atop the blood-soaked docks these creatures call home, carcasses of great sea monsters are hoisted by net and harpoon, and the stench of iron and salt permeates the air. Longshoremen work tirelessly to load and unload their vessels, harvest the remains of slain beasts, and repair or dismantle ships that have been salvaged or captured by competing fleets.\n<br><br>These lands are barren and bleak, and largely inhospitable. As a result, the praedaren repurpose much of that they scavenge into their infrastructure. In this wooden, rusting bricolage, one might find any number of foreign ships repurposed for a home, archways carved from monstrous jawbones, or tattered sails strung up for some protection against the elements.\n",

Some reborn exhibit the scars of fatal ends, their ashen flesh or bloodless veins making it clear that they've been touched by death.

Whatever their origins, reborn know a new life and seek experiences and answers all their own.</p>\n<h5 id=\"toc0\"><span>Faded Memories</span></h5>\n<p>Reborn suffer from some manner of discontinuity, an interruption of their lives or physical state that their minds are ill equipped to deal with. Their memories of events before this interruption are often vague or absent. Occasionally, the most unexpected experiences might cause sensations or visions of the past to come rushing back.</p>\n<p>Rather than sleeping, reborn regularly sit and dwell on the past, hoping for some revelation of what came before. Most of the time, these are dark, silent stretches. Occasionally, though, in a moment of peace, stress, or excitement, a reborn gains a glimpse of what came before.
