  <div>
    Adventures need to eat. While some are content to eat the same stale old
    rations, some prefer to apply their skills to be kept well fed... even in
    the depths of a dungeon where fresh ingredients can be... strange.
  </div>
  <div>
    Not only can someone with talent produce tasty treats, but being well fed
    can have a variety of benefits... particularly when eating correctly
    prepared magical ingredients.
  </div>
</div>

<h5>Related Tool & Ability Score</h5>
<div>
  Cooking works using cook's utensils. Attempting to craft a meal without these
  will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with these
  allows you to add your proficiency to any cooking crafting roll. Cooking uses
  your Wisdom modifier.
</div>

<h5>Duration</h5>
<div>
  The duration a meal remains edible depends on the type of meal made. A feast
  must be consumed within an hour, a snack lasts for 1 day, and rations lasts 1
  month.
</div>

<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<div>
  The materials for cooking are fresh ingredients and supplies. A fresh
  ingredient is something you harvest that can increase the quality of your food
  and sometimes provide supernatural boosts beyond mere satiation. Staples
  include seasonings, spices, flour or even turnips! Foods that last awhile can
  be cooked into perfectly fine meals, but have less benefits than eating a good
  meal. Some ingredients additionally have the exotic property, and may confer
  special effects.
</div>

<h6>Ingredient Expiration</h6>
<div>
  <div>
    Normal Ingredients expire very quickly, and must be used within 24 hours of
    being harvested or they become unusable. Preserved rations would fall into
    the staples category and cannot typically be used to cook anything besides
    basic meals.
  </div>
  <div>
    The ability to gain any sort of magical benefit is linked to its freshness;
    even well prepared preserved foods provide only the benefit of a Basic Meal
    (which is a satisfying and good tasting meal, but its benefits are not
    otherwise magical).
  </div>
  <div>
    Unlike Fresh Ingredients, Staples last significantly longer and do not need
    to have their expiration tracked for the purposes of this system.
  </div>
</div>

<h6>Satiation</h6>
<div>
  The magical benefits you get consuming rare and magical foods cannot be gained
  again until 24 hours have passed for any particular food. When combined with
  the ingredient expiration above, this typically means that any ingredient
  collected is only good for a single meal; this is intentional. You can harvest
  more if you wish, but cooking naturally is a profession of fleeting
  achievement and fickle opportunity.
</div>

<h5>Crafting Roll</h5>
<div>
  <div>
    Putting that together means that when you would like to create a meal, your
    crafting roll is as follows:
  </div>
  <div><strong>Cooking Modifier =</strong> your Cook's Utensils modifier</div>
  <h6>Success and Failure</h6>
  <div>
    For cooking, all crafting rolls must be made consequetively. Make all checks
    listed for the items. If you succeed a greater number of times than you
    fail, the meal is successfully completed, otherwise, it is inedible and all
    ingrediants are lost.
  </div>
</div>

<h5>Exotic Ingredients</h5>
<div>
  <div>
    While standard meals are made from a selection of ingredient types and
    generally a seasoning, exotic ingredients have specialized effects. When
    making a meal from these ingredients, the meal's effect is a combination of
    the effect of the exotic ingredients added.
  </div>
  <div>
    An Exotic Meal (meal cooked entirely from exotic ingredients) doesn't need a
    recipe and has a crafting time of 1 hour, and the difficulty is the
    difficulty of all the exotic ingredients added together, with 1 check needed
    per exotic ingredient added.
  </div>
  <div>
    Exotic ingredients can be combined with a standard meal by adding the DC of
    the standard meal to the combined difficulty of the exotic ingredients
    added. This can cause unusual meals and frequently has unattainably high
    difficulty to make it work, as adding random new components to meals
    typically wrecks the taste.
  </div>
</div>

<h5>Basic Cooking</h5>
<div>
  <div>
    While the rules present a handful of ways to use cooking for more exotic
    ends, the most common application of cooking is just to produce an edible
    meal during a long restâ€”something any adventuring group would welcome. This
    is called a Quality Meal and provides greater benefit than rations, though
    the benefits it provides are not magical, and merely stem from it being a
    satisfying meal. You can do so by expending 1 fresh ingredient of any type
    and 1 common supplies to feed up to 5 allies or willing creatures, or by
    spending common supplies per creature being cooked for. These materials must
    have been purchased within the last week. Any creature, even one not
    proficient with cook's utensils can take this action.
  </div>
  <div>
    You and all willing creatures (willing to eat your cooking) regain an
    additional Hit Die (up to their maximum). If you have proficiency with
    cook's utensils, creatures regain additional Hit Dice equal to your
    Proficiency bonus.

    <h6>Common Feast</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being
        prepared. After consuming this hearty meal, you become satiated for the
        next 24 hours. This is a hearty meal well surpassing the benefits of
        normal meals or rations, and each creature that consumes it regains an
        additional Hit Die during the next long rest.
      </div>
      <div>
        If cooked by a creature with proficiency in cook's utensils, creatures
        that consume this feast regain additional Hit Dice equal to the cook's
        proficiency bonus during the next long rest instead.

    <h6>Uncommon Feast</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being
        prepared. After consuming this hearty meal, you become satiated for the
        next 24 hours. You gain the benefits for a common feast, but can gain
        additional benefits by trading in Hit Dice that would be gained as part
        of your next long rest after consuming this meal. These Hit Dice are
        consumed after calculating how many you would have after the rest
        (including the benefits of the feast), but you can trade Hit Dice in
        this way you would normally lose if you have more than your maximum Hit
        Dice.
      </div>
      <div>
        You can trade Hit Dice in this way up to a number equal to your

    <h6>Meat Feast</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being
        prepared. After consuming this hearty meal, you become satiated for the
        next 24 hours. Consuming the essence of a properly prepared creature of
        great power confers some of its power to you while satiated by the
        feast.
      </div>
      <div>
        You can add +1/+2/+3/+4 to ability checks and saving throws of the
        prepared creatures highest stat (if multiple stats are tied, the cook
        chooses which when preparing the meal). Alternatively, the cook can
        bring forth exotic properties of the creature, conferring one trait of
        the cooked animal to those that consume it as per the following table
        (this replaces the benefit to ability checks and saves):
      </div>
      <table>

      <div>
        The details from the creature boon can be found on the creature stat
        block. The cook must be aware of the creature's property to make the
        meal imbue that property, and the GM may adjust the property in cases
        where it would not work for players or be too powerful as written. At
        the GM's discretion, any ability can be added to this list.

        Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being

      </table>
      <div>
        These benefits fade after 24 hours. You can't gain the benefits of
        another feast until these benefits fade and you are no longer satiated.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h6>Seaworthy Bouillabaisse</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being
        prepared. After consuming this hearty meal, you become satiated for the
        next 24 hours. The magical properties of the meal grant you immunity to
        sea sickness as well as advantage on Dexterity or Constitution saving
        throws involving the motion of sea vessels.
      </div>
      <div>
        Additionally, if you do not have proficiency in Water Vehicles, you can
        add half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to any check involving
        them for the duration.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h6>Heroes' Feast</h6>
    <div>
      A magnificent spread of food. Cooking this has the effect of casting the
      spell heroes' feast, except it's made of real food and not poofed into
      existence by strange magics.
    </div>

    <h6>What Doesn't Kill You... Feast</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being
        prepared. After consuming this dubious meal, you gain resistance to
        poison damage, and gain advantage on saving throws against being
        poisoned for 24 hours.
      </div>
      <div>
        If the source of a poison saving throw is the same as the source of the
        meat or poisonous reagent used to make the feast, the advantage against
        being poisoned by that creature or effect lasts one week.

    <h6>Flame Breathing Jerky</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        A tough jerky with exotic flavoring. Very spicy, uncomfortably so. After
        a creature consumes this snack as an action, they gain the following
        benefits for the next 10 minutes:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>You can't be put to sleep by magical means.</li>
        <li>You have disadvantage on Wisdom checks.</li>
        <li>
          You have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain
          concentration on a spell.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 10 feet
          of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking
          2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
          successful one.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        You can eat a number of pieces of this jerky equal to your Constitution
        modifier per day.
      </div>
    </div>
    <h6>Mint Chew</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        A chewy minty candy. You can pop one into your mouth as a bonus action.
        While being chewed (for up to 10 minutes), you are energized and can
        ignore the effects of up to 3 levels of Exhaustion for the duration, and
        can't be put to sleep by magical means.
      </div>
      <div>
        You can only gain this benefit once per day, after which consuming
        additional pieces of the candy has no effect until you finish a long
        rest.
      </div>
    </div>
    <h6>Morph Cookies</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        Consuming one of these has the effects of casting alter self, however
        you can't change the adaptation unless you consume another cookie. This
        effect doesn't require concentration to maintain, and can be extended by
        consuming an additional morph cookie.
      </div>
      <div>
        If the ingredient came from a mimic, you can additionally transform your
        appearance to creatures with a different basic shape than you, though
        you remain the same size.
      </div>
    </div>
    <h6>Seeing Sticks</h6>
    <div>
      <div>
        A stick of hard tacky substance. You can pop one into your mouth as a
        bonus action. While being sucked (for up to 10 minutes), you gain
        expanded senses and have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, saving
        throws against Illusion spells, and Intelligence (Investigation) checks
        to see through illusions, though because of the bad taste inherent to
        the formulation, continuing to suck on the seeing stick requires
        concentration, as if concentrating on a spell.
      </div>
      <div>
        By adding the optional common supplies ingredient, they can be
        sweetened, granting you advantage on Constitution saving throws made to
        maintain your concentration against spitting them out; this increases
        the DC of the recipe by 1.
      </div>
    </div>
    <h6>Quickening Candies</h6>
    <div>
      A small hard candy ball, with extreme caffineated properties. When you pop
      one of these into your mouth as a bonus action, you are under the effect
      of haste for 1d4 rounds. You still suffer the normal effect of haste
      ending when the effect ends.
